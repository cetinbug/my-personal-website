        "1": "Day 1",
        "2": "I think I have learned a lot today, or at least I have studied. I can briefly list the topics I have studied in the way I remember them:",
        "3": "Binary-bit-byte-shifting concepts",
        "4": "I spent time on things like binary system, bits and bytes, which I had researched before but hadn't gone into much detail. I learned the concepts of big endian, little endian.",
        "5": "Asynchronous programming",
        "6": "I learned the difference with synchronous programming. Asynchronous seems to stay in my mind as 'I will call you back'. In short: when there is an operation in our code that may take a long time or there is a situation that may prevent it, doing other pending tasks and returning to the undone operation after finishing those tasks is called asynchronous programming. In other words, it doesn't do the sequence of operations in a straight line, and if an operation on that line fails, it skips it and continues on its way. Then it goes back there again. It's faster than synchronous because it doesn't get stuck in the same position. The number of threads is also important, of course, with two or three threads instead of one thread, the process can end much faster.",
        "7": "Variables, arrays and object in Javascript",
        "8": "I was inspired by similar examples and for the first time I was able to write something on the console in the web browser. I consider it important as a first step. I did some small examples about object and creating the contents of an array. I learned about variable types.",
        "9": "About Scope",
        "10": "I learned how to assign variables (or constants) with var, let and const, and the scope properties when using them. I learned that assigning in the scope (i.e. local scope) between the curly brackets with let and const does not make sense for the global scope, which may actually be more advantageous than defining a variable with 'var'.",
        "11": "AST (Abstract Syntax Trees)",
        "12": "If we think of source code as a tree, it can be thought of as a branching process from the root to the leaf.  It's used to show the structure of the code, in the analysis phase of the compiler, and in static code analysis. According to Wikipedia, it's also used in program transformation systems, but I'm not familiar with it, but I've seen examples of how to extract an AST and I understand it.",
        "13": "To be able to provide the advantages of a loop without using a loop",
        "14": "I created a very simple 'do while' loop in PHP using only recursive function and if statement. Obviously I had some help by googling but I understood the logic.",
        "15": "Lastly SEO",
        "16": "I actually compared e-commerce sites that do equivalent / similar work to our e-commerce business on Turkish and foreign websites. Honestly, I want to research a little more, but it's not till tomorrow. I can say that I made an introduction to SEO I wish to learn and use information that will always expand my horizons tomorrow and beyond.",
        "17": "Day 2",
        "18": "I can say that most of the day was like a basic programming lesson with Javascript. But I think it added a lot. If I summarize the day quickly:",
        "19": "The topics I looked at during the day: 'Conditionals, Functions, Scope, Arrays, Loops, Iterators'.Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time for Objects because I examined more than 50 examples in the topics I mentioned and wrote similar codes on all of them one by one. I looked at the solutions in the parts I had difficulty, but they took a little more time because I wanted to grasp the underlying logic. The best information I learned today was actually about 'Iterators'. Seeing that a function can be used both as a 'data' and as a 'parameter', and then analyzing the code and understanding the logic was the most positive result of the day for me. In higher-order functions, while accepting the function as a parameter and performing operations, I realized that similar operations can be done without using callbacks. I think I understand the logic of the call-back function, but I haven't figured out exactly how the machine follows the order of operations. If nothing urgent happens tomorrow, I will learn that first thing.  Also, I saw a code on stackoverflow where event and callback functions are used in another programming language. It was very pleasing to be able to analyze and understand the code structure.",
        "20": "I did a lot of examples with arrays and functions, and I should mention that I learned how to use the concepts, not their names.",
        "21": "Variable",
        "22": "When you think about the structure of variables, a variable basically consists of two things: Identification and assigning a value. This is done by saving it in some part of the computer memory. Here I imagined the following example to myself: God creating man, and giving him a first name. And it is certain that this human being was born somewhere on Earth, even if God may or may not specify where on Earth this human being is located. And that God can directly change the position of this being if he wants to. The variable was man. The data it occupied in the memory was Adam. The memory was the world. The space it occupied was the location. Then I wanted to expand this example a lot, but there was no opportunity. Yes, it was an unnecessary (Stanley) Kubrickian approach, but I still wanted to write it down.",
        "23": "I learned that Google updates its algorithm every year, according to which Google puts its related site on the first page (or even at the top) in the browser. After doing some research, I found reports and articles published on this. One of them was actually talking about the importance of the speed of the website, or the speed at which it is displayed in the browser. I thought that if it takes a website on the first page among an average of 200-300 million results in 0.61 seconds, these pages should also be capable of loading quickly. Therefore, I observed the site's performance analysis, structural analysis, site load time (there are many concepts such as LCP, TBT, CLC). I examined these values from 'gtmetrix' and 'google page speed' and looked at their improvement (optimization) suggestions accordingly. Since even operations in milliseconds are very important in these matters, I suddenly thought of 'the advantage of defining a variable in block scope in terms of its transience in taking up memory space and issues such as not taking up memory space by always staying as a global variable'. I learned that small coding differences that seem so simple, image sizes within the site, CSS with Bootstrap actually cause excessive load times. Of course, these are not the main issues in SEO. There are more basic issues like Keywords. I will move on to more technical topics.",
        "24": "Summary of the Day : I am amazed to see that a person who simply thinks and counts '1,2,3' when asked to count to 3 can explain his own logic to a machine and succeed in doing so, and I continue to learn.",
        "25": "Day 3",
        "26": "Today I completed the Iterator and Object topic with examples. I felt that today was a bit less productive because I worked a bit too much yesterday and was sleep deprived. But it was also nice to complete the Beginner-Javascript course at CodeAcademy in two days. Next is to complete the Intermediate part. Of course, I'm trying to be a little fast here because there is a lot of information and I want to learn as much as possible, see how they are used, and even if I forget, when a project comes up or a question comes up, I want to know the algorithm, the code structure, the expressions in the code and their usage.",
        "27": "I found a Github source related to the topics, projects, examples in the 'Eloquent Javascript' book. When I get more into Javascript - even after each topic - I think I will look at them and reinforce them even more.",
        "28": "I looked at 'page speed' yesterday, one of the topics you talked about in your office meeting today, and when I overheard that Javascript-related improvements were needed, I actually felt like I was looking in the right place. I didn't look at SEO at all today, but I want to make up for it tomorrow.",
        "29": "Towards the end of the day, I actually saw the topics discussed in the meeting as brain gymnastics and I listened to them very much. When I heard you talk about artificial intelligence, the basic assumptions on which mathematics is based, I wanted to read 'Gödel, Escher, Bach' even more, but I think I will first watch the lectures about this book at MIT and then read the book.",
        "30": "Good night, and thank you very much for sharing your thoughts on computers/life/science/information/philosophy with us today, even though you don't have to.",
        "31": "Day 4",
        "32": "I'm mostly on Javascript again today, so I'll get right to the point:",
        "33": "Object",
        "34": "First I went into a bit more detail about Object, I learned about factory functions for example. Actually, it was a bit similar to a class, but I shouldn't talk big because I haven't really looked at the class. But factory functions was one of my favorite places about object for today.",
        "35": "Web Compatibility and Transpilation",
        "36": "After finishing the bbject topic completely, there was the browser web compatibility and transpilation topic. I looked at the documentation on caniuse.com and babel.io on how to return ES6 and ES5 related code from ES6 to ES5. I think in 2021 there is no syntax transfer from ES6 to ES5 format anymore, but a few years ago it was necessary because most of the web supported Javascript in ES5 format. This was done by using Terminal, downloading Node.js packages and downloading the babel library. I followed the process a bit to learn how to use Terminal, but after 2021 (when more than 97% of the web (according to caniuse.com) uses ES6) I preferred to just research this topic.",
        "37": "Class",
        "38": "I looked at constructor, instance, method and method call. I think I understand it but I need to look at the examples again. After that, I was thinking of completing the class topic today, but when I learned that we were going to enter next week, I left it halfway and I wanted to repeat everything we have learned so far from the book called 'Eloquent Javascript' with examples. I finished two chapters today. Tomorrow, if I can, I think I will look at all the examples, try to write them myself, write them, and if I have a problem and can't reach the solution, I think I will complete the day by looking at the solution manual. Since everything is explained in the most concise and understandable way in the book and I have been reading, researching and learning a little bit about the concepts for a few days, I think it will be a very good repetition. At the same time, I think it would be good if I repeat the points that I missed, or the subject content that I didn't look at much on purpose, but may be important. ",
        "39": "When I looked at SEO two days ago, I looked at the internet speed of our website, and the analysis of other parameters that I could access. At the same time, when I analyzed the competitors (or companies that trade on similar products) in the same way, I saw that our website was better as a website (in terms of software, such as connection speed, structural analysis of the site). But again, I don't think it is very good in issues such as social media, awareness, which can be handled within SEO but I think it doesn't concern me much. But I think that something good is done by putting in-site comments for communication with the customer. I don't know if you have noticed anything, but (using Google Analytics I think at least the marketing part has definitely noticed it) when our website and similar sites were searched on google, I came across a search result about the reliability of our website in suggestion searches. I have seen the same many times in the search suggestions of similar sites. Even when I looked at the comments of our website and similar sites in eksisozluk.com(a website like reddit in turkish), I saw that they touched on the issue of security. If one side of what we call SEO is the site, the other side is the user, and the middle is Google, we need to somehow give what the user wants, and I thought of a way to say that it is safe-reliable without expressing these words, but I couldn't find an answer. Obviously, my ideas about SEO have started to form, but I am only writing my personal opinions because it is not at the level I want.",
        "40": "Summary of the day :",
        "41": "When you do something you really love, you lose track of time. This means that I haven't been doing things with love for a long time. I didn't think so, but my logic made me say that now. I mean, it's a bit irrelevant, but it's from Morpheus: ",
        "42": "This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.",
        "43": "I wish to stay in Wonderland, to find out how deep the rabbit hole goes, to continue without saying 'Ignorance is bliss' (actually, why not?).",
        "44": "Day 5",
        "45": "Let me briefly describe today:",
        "46": "I think I commented the code that you asked us to comment today correctly, but of course the shortcoming was that I didn't specify the purpose of the functions. Actually, I wrote the result of the code on paper and tried to calculate it by hand, and because I was wasting some time, I didn't write the comment with the purpose of the function.",
        "47": "Most of the day was spent revisiting previous topics from the Eloquent Javasscript book, the author's interesting thoughts and thought-provoking explanations about the topics, and making/reviewing the examples there. I looked at 'class' a bit yesterday but not today to tell the truth. Tomorrow I plan to finish the 'class' topic completely, and I will if nothing unexpected happens. ",
        "48": "Day 6",
        "49": "Today was all about Javascript.",
        "50": "I completed the missing parts of the 'class'. I learned the inheritance structure and the static method.",
        "51": "I learned what a promise object is and why it is used, how to create a promise object, how to use structures like catch(), promise.all(), etc. I analyzed a structure that creates several promise structures in a chain and solved examples on top of it. Here's what I remember from today's work on 'promise':",
        "52": "They are used in asynchronous programs.",
        "53": "They are in three states: 'Pending, resolved, or rejected'. There was an example of housekeeping. It said that when you do housework, for example, you don't just vacuum the rooms. You also put the laundry in the machine, you can put the dishes in the machine. When you're done sweeping, you can clean the windows. But instead of doing these things one by one, the machines can work while you are doing your own work. This is where the asynchronous structure comes in. Javascript is actually a single threaded programming language, that is, a programming language that does one by one, but it has the ability to work like multi-thread with the event-loop. I looked a lot about event-loop and call stack today, I learned which operations are prioritized and how the system works. Let's go back to the example. If the washing powder is not put in the machine, the machine gives a warning, this is called rejected. If the machine completes its work, it means resolved. Initially it is in pending status. ",
        "54": "setTimeout (works with the Node API) can be used to delay the execution time. Here it is useful to understand the logic of the event-loop. setTimeout gives a callback function and a delay time as arguments.",
        "55": "When the promise is resolved, we can call it using .then().",
        "56": ".then() : 'I have a promise. When it settles, here's what I want it to be'.",
        "57": ".catch() in case of reject, which is our other handler.",
        "58": "We can also use Promise.all() to take advantage of concurrency.",
        "59": "Multiple promises in a chain instead of nested ones are more functional, so we should use them if we have to.",
        "60": "Understanding the problem in your code today was one of the most enlightening topics of today. It was a great example of the dangers of using global variables and how the code works differently with a very small difference between the two codes. I think I can read the code, I feel like I'm very close to seeing the 'big picture', but I think I'm getting a bit lost in the concepts and code. Since we are in the learning phase, I think it is more important whether we can take logical approaches or whether we can approach things analytically enough to make an effort and understand things, rather than expecting us to read, understand and analyze all the codes at once.",
        "61": "The most interesting thing about async-await today is that I learned that by using a few await constructs, the code can look and read like synchronous code. ",
        "62": "The purpose of async-await is not to get rid of .then() chains and write short code, but to make it look like synchronous code and thus help the developer to maintain and debug. It is also easier to store.",
        "63": "Singleton Pattern: It is the general name of a pattern that can be used with a getter structure to access the properties of a class whose constructor is private. In this process, there is only one instance.",
        "64": "Summary of the day: Veni, Vidi..",
        "65": "Day 7",
        "66": "Today was the first time I felt that I was struggling, so I stressed a little bit. I thought that I had to send you a code quickly, and when I found the solution directly on stackoverflow and copy-pasted it, I felt bad and looked at the topic again and wrote it myself. After all, the goal was not to write a code, but to produce something that I wrote myself, even if I was wrong. The reason was to approach with a prejudice and look for the solution when I encountered things related to logic circuits for the first time. But when I got into it, I realized that it could be done. In the code I wrote myself, I found a Half Adder. I couldn't find half of the Full Adder and put the others into code, but it would have happened if I tried a little. I can't use a sentence like I finished this and that today because I didn't. Today I realized the importance of practicing rather than reading something to write code. I adapted your last code to Javascript and got a smooth output. After that, I started commenting from the first function, but it stayed at the beginning. One last thing, after you left, I stayed in the office and worked a little more, but I didn't have any bad intentions, don't misunderstand, I stopped because working in the office is more productive than working at home. I should have informed you about this, but I didn't want to disturb you, sorry.",
        "67": "Day 8",
        "68": "Today, until lunchtime, I spent the day analyzing the given php code after it was converted to javascript. Then I looked at what is a design pattern and what are the examples. Especially I researched a lot about the singleton pattern. Actually, it has a simple logic, but I realized that I don't have a full command of the subject yet. When I came to the conclusion that I should make the constructor private in Javascript, I was a bit stunned. But I learned a structure that can behave like private without making the constructor private: Object.freeze (). Tomorrow I'm thinking to solve it on a good example. If I can, I'll try to do async, singleton, privacy with module pattern and factory pattern in one code. If I can't, I'm thinking to write and comment them all separately.",
        "69": "Today, while looking at design patterns, I learned that they are actually developed with object-oriented programming. Then I found something called UML (Unified Modelling Language). With UML, object-oriented models designed abstractly can be visualized. Even the simplest issues such as the inheritance relationship between classes can be visualized. In other words, design patterns seem to have been born as a reaction to very similar problems that have accumulated for years in software, and to produce a solution according to this pattern. In this way, the readability and correctability of the code increases. Because you can comprehend the design pattern and logic of the person who wrote that code before you.",
        "70": "Day 9",
        "71": "Today, until lunchtime, I tried to complete the assignment given yesterday. I researched Singleton and other constructs a lot and now I think I understand them. I want to learn things slowly, so I like to understand the existence of each construct and the reason for its use, instead of doing it fast and missing a lot of things. When I was doing the homework you gave me today, I realized that some structures need to be used a lot so that they are memorized. Just like learning a foreign language, you don't get much result without exposure. That's why I looked at Singleton, Factory patterns, async...await structure, and some try catch structure today. They were topics I've looked at before, but it was very good to repeat. Towards the end of the day I started to do the homework and most of it is done. Here's what I just need to do: Select the product the buyer wants randomly (or in the order it is found) from the array of unsold products, and then do the following operations. At the end of the day, I have the logic of that part in my head, and tomorrow I will continue where I left off.",
        "72": "Day 10",
        "73": "Today went well. While I was doing some parts of the assignment, I thought I couldn't do some parts, but I think I was able to get it done after thinking about it over and over again with a new breath. Although the outputs were not in the desired format, I am a little happy that the right things came out. It was especially nice to 'read' a code with your own labor, to analyze it, to shape it in line with what was desired. Inevitably, there are many places where logic comes into play and this gives you pleasure because you use your intelligence and create something. Yes, let's come to the things I need to write:",
        "74": "Today I learned better how a code using the singleton pattern works. I reinforced how to extract an object from a class and how to do other operations on those objects. I used everything we have learned so far such as .foreach, .map, .push, if statement, for loop, etc. in this example. Adding an object to an array, removing an object from an array (hiding it, more precisely, because of the method I used), using another function as an argument inside a function, in short, objects and arrays were on the agenda today. And I think making this example helped a lot. Most of the day was spent trying to understand the logic of the assignment in different ways and coming up with solutions.",
        "75": "I learned the concept of module today. We may need to save some code fragments in several different files within the same file and perform operations accordingly. Here, I learned the commands that will act as a bridge between those files. Although they have slightly different names in ES6 and Node Runtime environments, the general logic is the same. The 'module.exports' and 'require()' constructs are basically used for Node to export and import. I looked at a few examples and tried it myself.",
        "76": "This is actually a bit of preliminary research and reading for background information. I did some research on HTTP Requests and I came across concepts like 'event loop, heap, stack, event queue' and even 'XML, AJAX'. I did some reading about them and watched some videos to visualize them. In more detail:",
        "77": "The best feature of Javascript is that it's non-blocking, or asynchronous.",
        "78": "Websites with a lot of photos, for example, will have a better user experience with this feature. For example, a newspaper website might have large photo files. If you wait for them to load, the user doesn't want to stop or has to wait. But it is possible to read the articles in the meantime. ",
        "79": "Event loop is used for asynchronous function calls in javascript. Function calls are added to the stack. Function requests that have to wait for the server to respond are forced to queue. As soon as the stack is empty, the next ones are executed. The execute order is determined by the first in, first out rule.",
        "80": "Web developers also use event loops for a better user experience. ",
        "81": "I think I am starting to learn what I need to learn, but I am still at the very beginning. I hope the end will be good, that's all for today."

        "1": "Day 11",
        "2": "I think today was also productive. I also think that the topics were consolidated a little more with many examples on objects and arrays. 11 days have passed and I have started to form my ideas on many subjects.",
        "3": "I found a website today in the time I have left from my duties:",
        "4": "On this site I found some code that I wrote myself and some code that I found with setTimeout and other similar code structures, I ran it and looked at how it works. I got a little bit more ideas about call stack, callback queue, and web api's and how asynchronous structures work. I especially looked at examples related to async...await and after the array-object topics, I wanted to work on them a lot, but there was not much opportunity. I'm going to try to complete the last assignment tomorrow, because Saturday evening is the only free time I gave myself. ",
        "5": "Day 12",
        "6": "Today I did the given task first with functions and then with classes. I used static and constructor methods separately, sent an error message with throw, used functions like \".find, .filter, .foreach, .map, .toString, .includes\" and did operations on objects and arrays. I reinforced the information on the subject. ",
        "7": "Afterwards, while researching concepts such as Ajax, Xml, Json, I went over what Ajax is. With Ajax, it is possible to send a request to the server without refreshing the web page. Data can be received from the server and operations can be done on it. This allows for a more 'responsive' and faster user experience. Nowadays, JSON is generally preferred over XML because JSON is a part of javascript and this provides a 'lighter size' (When I try to translate some words into Turkish, a lot of time is lost, so I write like this, otherwise I have no intention of murdering the Turkish language :)). Both JSON and XML are used for packaging information. XMLHttpRequest object is used for communication with servers.",
        "8": "Before looking at how to make an HTTP request, it seems necessary to look at what HTTP is. Hyper text => linked word. HTTP is designed for communication between web browser and web server. It is a stateless protocol. This means that in the same connection, the server does not keep any hyperlink between two requests. The use of HTTP cookies and stateful sessions is allowed. Client-server protocol. This means that the request is initiated by the client (i.e. web browser). During the exchange of messages between client and server there are proxies. These can temporarily hold HTTP responses (caches) and can be used for subsequent HTTP requests. Proxies are used for a few other things but that seems to be enough for now.  The HTTP flowchart is as follows: 1. TCP connection is created. 2.HTTP message is sent. 3.Read the response sent by the server. Since the processes related to creating the HTTP request and processing the server response are a bit too detailed, I'll skip them for now. Thinking that it will come up again in the future, I think this research is enough for now.",
        "9": "I found two sites that draw road maps with very good explanations about SEO. I want to accept both of their explanations as a reference and finish this process. SEO topic of the day: Core Web Vitals.",
        "10": "There are three important issues, followed by other topics: Largest contentful paint (LCP)-Loading-, First Input Delay (FID)-Interactivity-, Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)-Visual Stability-. There are also issues such as mobile compatibility, safe browsing, HTTPs, and Intrusive Interstitials (which means something like an unexpected crack, I can make sense of it but I can't translate it). According to Google, especially the first three directly affect the ranking. And google penalizes good URLs more than rewarding bad, bad URLs (such as URLs with low CLS scores). Here's the thing: there is not always a correlation between page speed and ranking. So google doesn't just look at page load speed. Google is trying to measure the actual user experience (user experience). For a good user experience, the LCP should be 2.5 seconds or less. Element types in LCP: <img>, <video> block-level elements, element with background loaded image (with URL). I put our site back in one of the webpage tests and looked at the optimization suggestions it gave again and came across suggestions related to the live support section, but I could not come up with much of an idea. I know I'm at the beginning, but I think I'm trying my best. While I was browsing again, I came across things related to the site and the use of Alexa, but I couldn't quite understand it yet. I need to do more research, learn, practice. I feel very hungry for knowledge and I wish this hunger will continue for a very long time.",

        "13": "This morning I looked a little bit at how the web works and then when I was given the task I concentrated on it. I thought the question was very good and there were some things to think about. I thought a bit too much and wanted to use constructs that I hadn't used for a few days. I think I used a bit too much trial and error. For example, I hadn't used the switch case structure for a long time. Obviously it wasn't difficult, but it was necessary to set up the algorithm well. Of course, my code had its shortcomings, but in general, I enjoyed what I did, yes.",
        "14": "I started to look at XML, JSON topics later. Yesterday I was already familiar with these topics while I was researching AJAX. But today I learned how to use JSON. JSON is useful for communication between the web server and the client. And it is a completely string structure, that is, it is a text-based format. What I really learned about JSON today was the \".parse()\" and .stringtify()\" methods.  For example, a JSON object is very similar in structure to a javascript object, but there is a big difference. One is an object, the other is just a text (string). So it is not possible to see a JSON object as a javascript object.  To return it to an object, the \".parse()\" method is used. If the opposite is desired, that is, if we want to turn the object into a string, the stringify method is used. So why do we need JSON or XML? Because the data exchange between the client and the web server does not use a direct javascript object; it uses JSON, a text file. I examined examples of the parse and stringify methods and printed them to the console myself to see the differences between them.",
        "15": "Obtaining JSON: For this we need to use an API: \"XMLHttpRequest\" or XHR for short. It is a Javascript object that allows us to make a network request to get resources from the server through Javascript. This allows us to update the page without refreshing the page. I saw a detailed and at the same time simple code structure for obtaining JSON and calling request response. I read it, I think I understand it.",

        "19": "Application Programming Interface. Unlike a user interface, an API is a set of rules and features within a piece of software that allows interaction between software. A web developer (or other developers, because it's not just a technology used on the web) can use it in their application to interact with the user's web browser. For example, with the getUserMedia API, audio and video can be captured. Geolocation API can also be used to get location information. Most APIs are only valid in a secure context (HTTPs). The reason is that major attacks can be caused by using APIs. The main purpose of HTTPs is to prevent MITM (man in the middle attack) attacks from powerful APIs. Since some APIs are powerful, they provide a great advantage for those who attack the system. With these attacks, attackers can gain low-level access to the user computer. Or they can access user data. And user privacy is invalid. For non-local resources to be secure, they must be in the form of \"https:// or wss://URLs\".",
        "20": "Document Object Model. It is an API for interacting with XML and HTML documents. DOM is a document model that is loaded in the browser and presents the document as a node tree (node tree, I've seen a similar tree structure when I was studying data structures). DOM is one of the most used APIs on the web. In the document, it allows the code to interact with and access each node and allows the code to run in the browser. In other words, DOM connects the web page to the script or programming language by providing the structure of the document. With the DOM we have a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends at a node and each node has an object. The DOM method gives us access to this tree and allows us to change the structure, style, and content of the document. Brief description: DOM is a data representation of an object on the web that contains the content and structure of a document. It represents the document as nodes and objects, which allows the programming language to interact with the web page. DOM is not part of JS and is a web API used to create websites. Node.js runs on the computer but provides the APIs and the DOM API is not a core part of Node.js. So DOM doesn't depend on any programming language and provides a structured representation of the document with a single API.",
        "21": "It changes asynchronously or synchronously. I learned that we should use synchronous outside web workers, but I haven't researched that part in detail. But there is something I learned: We should definitely choose asynchronous for performance. Synchronous blocks execution and causes 'freezing'. That means unresponsive user experience.",
        "22": "Today I tried to learn how to do operations with XMLHttpRequest. I think I understand the places I looked at. In one example, it followed some steps to create a request and performed the operation: The information from the API was accessed with a URL. In the AJAX part, the response type (JSON), the event handler part (for example, when XHR is OK, what to do when the server says 200 OK! Using two parameters (GET, 'destination), the request was opened and sent. The example was this: There was an API on a web page and it would print similar words that rhymed with a word entered by the user in the result section. What was the purpose of the example? No matter how many times I did a word search on the generated site, there was never a page refresh while the results were being printed. So I think Ajax worked for this.",

The best thing I learned today was something you said about the subject: There are 3 ways to create CSS. If it is in HTML, our CSS file changes according to the place of use as inline and internal. If we create another CSS file in the same folder as HTML, then we call it external CSS.",

I have examined many examples, played with them and designed a few sites, but if you say how much you have learned; If you say add 3 and 2, I will do about the subject. Because I learned the definition of 3 and 2 and how to use them today. But if you say sin3°+sin2°=?, since I don't know the meaning of sine and degree, I need to research what they are, look at their examples, look at them and produce solutions on the problem myself. In other words, I may not be able to do it on command, but I can do it after researching and learning how it is solved. This is how it was briefly today.",
        "29": "I saw many different terms such as flex, inline-flex, flex-wrap, relative position, justify content, the difference between block-inline, the placeholder property of the # sign for the URL in the href, hover, align-items. I practiced with these terms. But I know that it will be more memorable if I am given a single task and write HTML and CSS one by one by doing a search on it. So today I tried to lay a little foundation, and tomorrow I will practice more, if we are going to continue working on this subject.",

I tried to understand why each code was written, what function each of them had. Of course, it seemed very complicated because what I was looking at was the result of a great work. So I tried to examine each element step by step. Some places seemed unnecessary at first, for example, I thought that a code in the navigation bar was useless at first. But then, when I reduced the size of the browser, I saw that code had a function. I saw that responsive web design is not easy. There were traces of Bootstrap in some places, for example, 6 div elements in the footer section caught my attention. Until noon, I tried to make some parts of the header part by simulating it myself. Did it work? No, but I think it will, because it's not very difficult, but it's very challenging. I realized that I liked algorithm-related subjects more.",

First I looked for the easy way. I found out that there is already a function for this on the internet, but since the question asked me for an algorithm to extract meaningful objects from a string text, I broke away from Google and thought about the algorithm. I had built an algorithm that I thought was quite logical and started working on it. Then, when I saw a different solution with your approach, I put mine aside, but tomorrow I will work on how I can apply my own thinking while analyzing your solution.",
        "34": "Since you said \"expecting you to do it with regex is like asking you to throw a missile\", I became more interested in regex and then I always looked at what regex is, what it is used for, and its examples and uses. I found some of the requests in the xmlString text with regex. I couldn't find a few places I couldn't find, but as you said, I guess it is not necessary or available to find everything with regex.

I don't think there is any problem in HTML, but I confuse the concepts in CSS. That's why I had a hard time designing a website today. At the end of the day, at least I was able to make a responsive header. Since the subject is very much about visuality, I will watch videos on it at the end of the day and tomorrow and try to do something myself. That's how I can summarize today. I will do my best to make up for the things I am missing.",

But it was a bit of a problem for me that the width of the body part was not as wide as the page width. Then it seemed to me that the right things are slipping or will slip into complete copy-paste, but if there is time, I will try to do it myself again.",

There are even a lot of differences, but it was an opportunity to examine and reproduce the design of a website, how the structure of the site is, especially on our website.  I think I made a lot of flexbox examples. Although I am still a little confused, I learned a little bit about what the concepts are used for, and the way they are used by practicing a lot. I also did exercises from the site I linked yesterday.",

Actually, you asked the question and you gave the answer, I'm sorry about that. I would have preferred to spend some time on it and learn it. But it was fast to reach the solution in this way, of course. First of all, we had a JSON String. After converting it into a readable object with a \"parser\", we could make changes on the website with it and the JavaScript code we would write. Which is what the assignment was about. In other words, our goal was to scan the data in the JSON object, match it with the appropriate parts of our website that we wanted to match and make the changes we wanted. The algorithm we need to set up: Scan each element of the JSON object for a particular property. Do this by creating a loop. Then include the part of the desired HTML document in the loop and update the values for each element. The part I had difficulty here was not a JSON object, object, array, or html. The problem I had was finding HTML elements through JavaScript. This is the biggest thing I learned today: To be able to find HTML elements with their defining properties like id, class, tag and to be able to update on them.",
        "51": "The first part of the day was spent making updates on the site I'm trying to create similar to our website. I completed the missing parts in the header section. I can list what I'm missing, but there wasn't much time to complete them: body width, the correct adjustment of the elements on the right side of the carousel, places where I still need to make a few edits (such as the popular categories section), the options that appear in the quick search section, the menu bar that is fixed up when the page is scrolled down, and the most important missing is responsive design. For example, when the page size is reduced, the design on the original page does not appear. There are some places, but the majority is a bit problematic. While talking about so many shortcomings and depressing, let's come to the pros. After all, you need to make prons&cons to be realistic. One of the pluses was this: I really learned how the page structure is in a basic sense. I encountered many of the HTML elements, many of the features used in CSS and used them in many places. Even if I still get confused when using flexbox-related terms, I can find the solution immediately. I think it will improve even more with practice. For example, today I provided access to the live support pop-up box by linking to it within the site. Yes, it was easy, but it was nice and simple to do. In general, I think these are simple things, but they take time and effort. I think this is also very normal for our level.",

Your explanations at the end of the day were also useful. But today I thought about this: What is an engineer? If there is engineering for grass, flowers, electricity, buildings, bridges, airplanes, cars, business, physics, mathematics, space, meteorology, metallurgy, computer, software; how could we express this very big term. I think it was the ability to find solutions related to a specific subject. So what could be the similarity of engineering to art? I told myself it could be creativity (typeof 'da-vinci' === 'engineer-artist'). The difference is that in one case the aesthetics were important, in the other the usefulness, convenience and other human factors were important. In this work we are doing, what is connected to art is the issue of creativity. The artwork may not be useful in our daily lives, but the things we make should be useful. Artwork can be made with a passion for perfection, but when we want to achieve perfection, we may never get the result we want and we may become obsessive. If making the fastest car in the world is our definition of perfection, we can think like this: You can take a picture of the fastest car in the world, you can draw it. You can imagine it. But you have to work hard to build it. You need to work as a team. It requires compatibility with people. It requires a lot of money. There may be time constraints. In short, there are many factors to reach perfection, and even if we can't reach it, I think it is enough to take appropriate steps on the way. Creativity? I think developing an algorithm suitable for each problem and reaching a solution is the artistic part of this job. And I think this should be the most enjoyable part. I mean, I guess it's more enjoyable than changing colors in CSS. Of course, this depends on the perspective of individuals, just like most things are relative.

It was simple but it was a good example: The problem was an algorithm to give different random colors to 16 different elements created on a web page. I liked the solution very much: Open a loop, let it repeat 16 times, and then use \".createElement\" and \".appendChild\" to add 16 separate \"div\"s to the body (as children of the body). Then a function is written in \"rgb(-,-,-,-)\" that picks a random number between the largest number and the smallest number that can be written. After that, a few different structures are used to change the backgroundcolors of these divs on every mouse click. These structures were as follows: \".addEventListener, .eventobject, event handle property, event handle attribute\".Of these different constructs, which all give the same result, today I looked at \".addEventListener\" the most.",

It was really cool that it didn't show up until you clicked the button, and then it would show up and then disappear when you clicked on the video. As a similar example, I think the fact that a photo on our site comes up when you click on it was a good example for us, both in JavaScript and a little about SEO.",

In other words, this code could have been written somewhere else or on another platform and converted to JavaScript here. And I realized that it was. It was a JavaScript adaptation of similar structures written in jQuery. It took me a while to understand how the code works. I realize this: at first some things seem very difficult to the eye, but when you figure out the structure, you realize how simple it actually is. Yes, I may not be able to write this code now, but I think it is also important to understand its algorithm, which I think I understand. During the day, I looked at the event topic again and looked at examples about the manipulation of the html DOM element with jQuery. I think today has been very productive because I feel like we learn something as we come up with problems and try to find solutions to them. In fact, we have seen structures such as object, array, and loop 157.3545 times (the principle of let me enter fractions so that it is thought to be correct), but there may still be missing. I think this is bad, but I think we did a lot of things and learned new things in 22 days. At least I can easily say that for myself.

I also looked at the topics we covered before. I looked again at topics such as method, function, class, promise. Are there places that don't understood? I think very little (although I shouldn't talk big). Yes, there are concepts that I have forgotten how to use, but after a little research, I remember and understand them immediately, so I don't think it will be much of a problem. My only problem is that I don't practice a lot in CSS topics and have a little difficulty in site design. I actually created a site structure by looking at your website and I think it was enough for the first study, but it can be developed further. This was one of the two biggest things that stuck in my mind. The other was the weakness of not making examples on async and promise. We will probably do it later, but that is one of the shortcomings I can say.",

When we examine the carpet, each column has groups of repeating patterns. At the end of each group, the same group is added again from the beginning. I can only guess this because we cannot see the rest of the repeating structures due to the cut of the carpet. But if you look carefully at the end and the beginning of the 3 columns, the repeating structure is visible. I completed the drawing part using only flexbox. Although the skeleton structure is similar, I thought about how to return it to the data structure and how to return it to a two-dimensional array, but I haven't found a result yet. I will sleep early, wake up early and think again. ",

I made a small addition to the code to update all of these (including an element and its child elements) with a single code. Yes it worked, it was actually simple. I also added another addition to delete an unwanted property if it exists in our tags. Actually, apart from these simple additions, I wanted to use different and very nice algorithms. But to tell the truth, I didn't really think about what I could change in the DOM. Because the most basic things were already in the algorithm. I looked a little bit at what I can change with jQuery to take advantage of it, and if there is nothing more important in the rest of the time, I will look again.",

I wanted to try my luck with the last solution method that came to my mind. But due to a logic error, the code I wrote did not give the correct output. Frankly, I congratulate myself on my effort. After all, I tried, but I tried the wrong thing, and I finally realized what I should have realized in the first place. Now I realize even more clearly that when I am given a problem, I need to understand the problem thoroughly and then develop a good solution. Actually, I know this, but as I come across different algorithms, there are completely different solutions that can be developed for them. And although this is really difficult at first, it makes you very happy when you can write something in a foreign language (programming language). ",

While studying the algorithm, I came across \"Dynamic Programming\". I learned the differences between using DP and recursive functions to get a result. It is possible to get Fibonacci numbers with a recursive function. But so many operations are assigned to the callstack that it tires the system unnecessarily and makes the process longer. To find the 20th term of the Fibonacci numbers, 21981 calculations are needed, whereas with the dynamic programming algorithm, 55 calculations are needed to complete the process. Memoization technique is very useful in this sense. With memoization, a cache-like structure is used and what has been calculated before is kept in an object. And when needed, the direct can be retrieved from there and repeated calculations are prevented. ",
        "45": "When I looked back at the example, I realized that our goal was to reduce the width or height of a photo while keeping the parts of the meaning or content that were important and that we didn't want to deconstruct. To do this, it was necessary to analyze the pixels in the photo and to do things accordingly. We defined each pixel in the photo according to its color intensity (pixel's energy) and performed operations on it. The goal was to create a map for the pixel energy of the entire image and to obtain a path on that map. If the width was to be narrowed, the path with the lowest energy density on the energy map from the top to the bottom of the image had to be selected. For this, the Dynamic Programming algorithm was used (there is a comparison like Dynamic Programming vs Divide-and-Conquer, but I will look at that later). ",

I looked at the complaints about the site, comments on blogs, sample questions in the bot or live support section of other similar sites. I saw people who entered the \"agar.io\"-like game on the site and accessed the game from the site, and I was a little curious and I searched their mouths about the site.

So far, we've worked with JavaScript on the client-side, that's how we've worked. We haven't gotten into the server-side, the back-end, the brain part of the site. Yes, that's where express.js comes in. But here's the thing: why do we need express? For example, node.js has an http module, isn't that enough? It's not enough. Yes, both are used to create servers, but express.js offers many features that are incomparable. For example, it is also used in API based app design. It provides an MVC-like structure.

Initially I found a few resources but I didn't understand the reason for the existence of what I was researching because I was stuck on them and they took more time explaining the technical terms than the logic.

        "4": "REST is the foundation of the web's architectural principle.",
        "5": "It's one of the strangest but most fundamental things on the Web: The client (the browser, the requesting machine) can interact with the server (the responding machine) and the resources it hosts (owns or offers) without knowing anything about them beforehand. So there are two separate machines. They don't know each other, but they can do things with each other. How? If machines are nouns, we can form sentences using different verbs for each noun. So by using each machine with a verb, we can make it interact with the other machine with a verb that they have in common. What is our verb? Before we define the verb, one thing must be clear: both the server and the client must agree on the media being used, and they must use it. This is our initial condition. Since we are working on the web, our media in this case will be HTML.",
        "6": "The API takes the principles of REST and thus creates what we call a REST API. The client has nothing about the structure of the API. The server must provide whatever information is necessary for the client to interact with the web service. For example, let's look at the HTML form structure. The server specifies the location of the resource and the required fields. The browser does not know in advance where to deliver the information and what information to deliver. The information of the forms must be provided by the server.",
        "7": "What are these things we call in practice and what is the connection with HTTP? HTTP is built around resources and verbs. Verbs like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE are applied to resources according to the instructions provided by the server. For example, we have a user database provided by a web service. This service uses a hypermedia based on JSON (application/json+userdb). Client and server are programmed to understand this format. But neither of them knows anything about each other. For example, by making the request with GET we get a response in JSON format.  In JSON we can find resources from a property called links. This is also called hypermedia controls.  So we can manipulate the resources using different HTTP verbs. And the only thing we know on the client side is our media definition.",
        "8": "GET request should never be used to update information. Let's think about adding products to the cart.  GET should be idempotent. There should be no difference between sending a request twice and sending it once. This means making the request cachable. Adding products to the cart is not idempotent (doing it twice adds a copy of the product to the cart twice). Therefore, a POST request should be used for this type of operation.",
        "9": "Another topic: Resources gain identity through URIs. There needs to be a generic way to find resources, to tell the client where they are. A URI provides that. The difference between a URI and a URL: every URL is a URI, but not every URI is a URL. Why? URI specifies the identity, URL specifies the location. So both URL and protocol are specified, like HTTPS.",
        "10": "Let's get to the point. Some reasons and things that define REST:",
        "11": "We need to use an architecture that can support high traffic volumes so that our server can process responses from different clients. Therefore, we don't want to tire (or bottleneck) our server by remembering information from previous requests. That's why we restrict each request-response pair between client and server by making them independent of each other. That is, the server doesn't have to remember the old request in order to respond to a new request. So we want our interaction to be stateless.",
        "12": "In order to further reduce the load on our server, caching is allowed to avoid redoing the calculations already done for the client. That is, a snapshot of the initial response provided to the client is taken. If the client makes the same request again, the snapshot is provided to the client instead of having to do the calculations again to create the initial response. However, since it is a snapshot, it has an expiry date, which the server provides. If the expire date has not passed and the response is updated, the client will not see the updates unless the catch in expires or the page is rendered again.",
        "13": "If we talk about layers: Each layer in our system interacts with its neighboring layer, so our client layer interacts with our server layer. But if we have another server layer that helps our main server layer to process a request, the client does not communicate directly with these layers. As said, everyone communicates with their neighbor. The server will forward the request as it should.",
        "14": "What was the API? Let's move away from the cliché that API is labor and look at the details: The use of one piece of software by another piece of software.  The goal is to communicate between apps. Making the machine talk to the machine. Web API for example: whenever a request comes in, an app sends data to the client.  API is not only in web development. Using a file system or http module is actually an example of API. As you said, the operating system, windows is a program. And this program allows us to use a piece of code (api) from within itself. And of course with authorization, authentication, etc. it prevents us from manipulating the main program from that piece of code and accessing unwanted places. ",

We need to come up with a system that thinks about the relationship between the machines that talk and communicate with the HTTP protocol in a way that is most optimized for us and that suits our needs. Or at least we should create the algorithm for now. Since it was said to have 3 servers and one of them holds some information, I treated it like a database. The database server was like a repository where all our data was stored. Access to this repository should only be done by our servers, and the client should only be able to perform operations such as adding and removing files not on our database server, but on a separate server with the authorizations given to it. For this situation, I said that the operations should take place in a limited area where the authorizations are specific (just like how paypal, twitch, youtube, google provide us with apis when we write our web applications and we can do something within the limited area they give us). For example, the file listing process or file addition/deletion process should take place in this area according to this logic. I thought that these can be realized by using the methods (functions) provided on the database server.",

But no, I really enjoy it and the last thing I want is for this beautiful thing to be spoiled. So if I compare myself to people, I won't be happy, my motivation will drop. I get stressed. That's why it's best to be interested in what I do, not in people. I think it is a very, very big chance to earn my bread and do what I love.

After more than 1 month of working with JavaScript, I realized while looking at the PHP content that I've actually learned something. I was surprised how fast the topics in PHP can be understood. Of course it's not deep, but in general it's much faster to understand the concept and the content. That's why I thanked everyone who contributed to the production today. The story you told with the symbolism of the torch illuminating the dark forest is of course true, but my torch still gives very, very weak light. So thank you very much for lighting my way again with the big torch. While I was studying PHP today, I actually felt like I was studying JavaScript, because the basic structures (coding, programming, scripting, whatever you call it) overlapped in many places. But I was especially surprised today: I felt like there were millions of functions in PHP. It really seemed like there was a built-in function for every topic. While I was reading those functions and their functions, I was wondering how the algorithm of this function was built and written. It was similar to how I felt when I was looking at your example for DOM manipulation in JQuery. I also realized something today when I was studying PHP. We had actually done many examples of object-class in JavaScript and I couldn't make sense of their general concept at the time. Even though I understood a little bit why we did it, I never thought that the general name of this was OOP (or the building block of OOP). I realized it today while reading about OOP in PHP, of course. The readability of such a long paragraph is of course very low, but I would like to add one more thing: When I learn something, when I try to understand the concept, when I learn about other people's solutions to problems and concepts in web development, my hunger is not satisfied and I want to look at it again after a little rest. This is very strange for me. Yes, I loved math and physics in high school, yes I used to study a lot, but the only time I remember having this craving was when I was learning what trigonometry was. I am very happy to have the same childish and pure desire again after so many years. Thank you very much again from the bottom of my heart. I hope we will not let you down in return for your labor and investment, and we will learn a lot too. We can raise the machine (computer, web server, client, whatever you call it) language to the level of \"native speaker\". I mean, it is very difficult, but why not, right?  In short, we become much more \"useful\" in the company we work for.

Honestly, it was so much fun to play with the code that I lost a bit of time because I was always doing other things, figuring out what does what, what to do with what, what to do with what, etc. When you then printed the JavaScript code again, it was very easy to return it to PHP. The only problem is that I don't know PHP very well, so I had to look up new concepts one by one. But I think that's normal too. The most beautiful thing I feel today is that we can have a direct client side output with code written in PHP. The ugliest thing I feel today is the question of how we can debug in PHP.

In particular, I can say that I did a study by looking at the counterparts (if any) in PHP of what we have encountered so far in JavaScript. I couldn't ask you anything because I didn't have many questions in my mind. I was able to ask google and find the parts that were stuck. In JavaScript, most things were built on objects. I couldn't figure out which data structure is more dominant in PHP, but I was surprised by the abundance of functions (although in JavaScript they are also considered as objects, I don't know how it is in PHP). I found it interesting that the object structure, which we learned before as an instance of a class and an associative array, was created in two ways. I wondered if only associative array could be done, but I answer my own question by saying that it is not possible to write something unnecessary for a program that has been running for years (the answer is probably related to the need to create the object-class relationship). Today, for example, I saw two methods like \"__constructor(), __destructor()\" created in the class. At first I thought it was very similar to getter setter logic, but it turns out that \"__constructor\" is the same as \"constructor\" in JavaScript. The most surprising thing for me today was to encounter \"access modifiers\" such as \"public, private, protected\" which I had never encountered in JavaScript. Since it was the first time I encountered these terms, I tried to understand them well. I think I grasped them quickly because they were simple. Just like in JavaScript, there was a static method here. I also encountered \"classes and methods\" such as namespace, iterables, trait, interface, abstract. Since I haven't solved any examples on these, I assume that they will be erased from my memory immediately. So I may need to look at them in a little more detail.",

        "2": "Today, we examined and did the conversion of a program we worked on before and coded in JavaScript into PHP. To be honest, it was not difficult to convert it to PHP. In fact, nothing is difficult (at least from what we saw). I think it was only difficult because we were still new and we were seeing terms for the first time. The best part of today was that we contributed to something we had done before. If we were expected to build a structure from scratch, it would have been more difficult. I think it will be harder from now on, of course, because it was just like an exercise. It was like getting familiar with the terms, getting familiar with writing in PHP. Like practicing what, what does it do. After the server side (no matter how questionable the optimization is), I tried to combine it with HTML-CSS-JavaScript. Before the JavaScript part, I was a bit stuck on how to do the form operations. Then I solved that problem with your help. Although I don't encounter any problems when I process on the server side, there are some problems when processing data from the client. I thought of it as \"future development\" (when I say future, I wouldn't be surprised if it happens tomorrow). ",

I guess I'll have to look at it again with a fresh head, but I was sad not to do that. What was it? We received the data from the user with the \"POST\" method. We wrote it to a file with a \".txt\" extension. I can write to and read from the file. The elements written to the file jump to a new line with each new element \"constellation\" entry; I created a new array from each of the rows (multidimensional in total, of course), and from there I completed the part we want with array_column and in_search. Maybe it was a long way, but it worked. But I think I made some logical mistakes in the rest of the process and it didn't work. I will try to solve this first thing tomorrow.",
        "10": "What I learned today: I can say that I learned that GET and POST methods are used to retrieve data from a user and send a response to his request.

Also, when we first started, you said to look at SEO for an hour a day, but it has been a long time since I looked at that, because we were thinking about coding. That's always on my mind too. ",
        "13": "First of all, today was very productive. I was able to solve the problem I had yesterday much more easily in the morning with a relaxed mind. After completing what I needed to do in PHP, with your guidance, I researched topics such as SQL, MySQL, communication between PHP and Database. Honestly, I was going to try to combine it with the code we wrote directly on top of it, but I left it for tomorrow. The only bad thing about today was that I had a little cold last night and felt weak during the day. I took it upon myself today to query the database, connect to the database from PHP, basically open PHPMyAdmin and play around with it a bit. I looked at examples of how to create and keep cookies, how to save user information to the database after pulling it from the incoming form information. I think I was able to get the concept down a bit (reading and studying will only go so far of course, tomorrow will be practice time on the job). Before I came to the company, I had also looked a little bit about connecting to a database, mostly by watching youtube and trying something myself. Of course that works too, but reading and understanding from documents and written sources and trying to work on it also contributed a lot. Even though there were books and questions in the university, sometimes I would listen to Indian or Western lecturers or knowledgeable people and learn from them. I don't think it was necessary to explain this, but I wanted to add it. Since this is what we are doing now, I don't think I have much difficulty, especially in this abundance of information. Sometimes I might get a little bit carried away, but that's what drives me. Honestly, everything that I've been going through for 1.5 months is whipping me up to work. I feel like I'm looking for a place to be whipped, the process before work, the process at work, the people, the work that I love (which I don't feel like work, I feel like a hobby. This is of course not only because we are working on software, but also because of what the environment, i.e. you, has to offer), the money earned (it ends the dependence or burden on the family), thoughts about the future and the past, the contributions of world-class people in the field I work in and the fact that I can smile when I see what they are doing, the possibility of improving myself and making a contribution to this \"community\", both to myself, to the people I work for and earn money from and am responsible for, and also to the people who invest in me, and to other developers who specialize in their field. In a positive way, of course. ",

I didn't understand why deleting a row from the database and then adding the next rows is the number after the primary key of the deleted row. It still makes little sense. If I deleted a user, another user should be able to get that id instead. But if this is the system, maybe we should work accordingly and not question it too much.",

        "20": "What I enjoyed the most today was that I could access the database in PHP and do whatever I wanted. SQL query is actually something that can be done easily with a little practice because each query is like a sentence. It is very simplified for the user (us). So I don't think we will have much difficulty. I saved the user data. I was able to compare the data coming from the client with the data in the database and make transactions. Then I was going to get into issues like updating information, but I realized that I needed to send the user a session id or cookies in general. Then I did some research on that, the reasons, how it is used, and examples. It's something I've looked at before, but I wanted to take it slow because I didn't need to do it at a super fast pace right now.",
        "21": "The most comforting thing today was this: It was much easier than two days ago when we used a \".txt\" file as a database and saved the data. I didn't know there was such a difference.

I really lived the concept called over-engineering in switch-case to the fullest. It was a mistake not to see this. It was also a mistake to relate to the database in both object oriented and procedural way. I did that because I thought it would be necessary to establish only prepare and object-oriented structure in data exchange from the user, but from now on I will definitely pay attention to this and try not to make the same mistake. Apart from these, I think I was able to fulfill the task given today. I also think my code literacy has improved. Since the courses at the university are generally based on just giving the lecture and passing the course, and if the person does not have a special interest in the subject by studying the questions, he usually completes the process without learning or acquiring anything because he only memorizes. However, I think I learned a lot of things in these 2 months because there were no questions or problems of passing the course. Tasks were given. Necessary things to know were explained. And I tried to produce. Of course, there were copy-pastes and benefiting from other people's work in this process. I didn't reinvent the wheel, but I learned how the wheel is attached to which car, which wheel is attached to which car, and what the wheel does. And I am very pleased with this. I hope it's not an illusion because I feel that the labor and work really pays off.",

        "26": "Today was really the most unproductive day. Because of the problems that were on my mind. I'm glad we talked. What I did during the day. Since there was no task, I generally did a lot of research, anything I came across that I didn't know about PHP and that I could understand. For example, when adding users' passwords to the database, I encrypted it with the password_hash() structure. Then I corrected every part of my code that is used everywhere about the password accordingly. If you ask why you used this, among all the structures; I researched structures such as sha1, sha2, md5, crypt() and many more. I learned that different libraries related to cryptography created with hashing can also be used for PHP. But in the most general sense, since the hash structure contained in md5 or sha1 is much easier to decode, I learned that with today's technology and equipment, something called \"salt\" is also added to the hash structure. While it is possible to enter or create this manually, for PHP, I found out that password_hash(), which is built-in in PHP, automatically assigns a random salt structure and uses it. And since it is one of the most recommended encryption methods both in the PHP manual and on different sites, I used it. At first, I thought that it would be much more secure if I used different hash structures together, but I was told that there were damages to this in a few good sources. To tell you the truth, I read about those drawbacks too, but it was a bit up in the air. ",

If the user wants to select a product and add it to the cart, I was going to show the products in the cart with the \"mycard.html\" file and also look at how to do operations on the total amount and the products in the cart. I searched a little and found a very nice example on the subject. It was an example where operations were done in a class-object structure. While I was going to analyze the concept and examine that example, I was given a new task. I thought a lot about what to do next. I rearranged the header I made in the previous assignments because I didn't like it very much. Again, I didn't feel completely comfortable with it, but I think it's enough for now. Tomorrow I want to enter the content section and get the main concept of the html and CSS parts. So I can rearrange the parts I don't like. After creating a skeleton, and if the design looks good, I will leave adding something with JavaScript for the next day. In short, my biggest goal tomorrow is to create the skeleton of the structure I want in general. Then making improvements on that skeleton.",

But what trendyol did in some places was also good. Obviously, it is obvious that it is necessary to appeal to the general user base.

In Javascript or any other language, it requires problem solving skills to get to the desired solution, but once solved, it is easy.",

Here are the missing or problematic parts: I didn't delete and edit unnecessary details in my code in some places. I need to look at them again. The photos in the second carousel are very light after the first loop in the visible part. And when I click somewhere other than the button on the sort button, the content disappears.

        "6": "Solid Principles- The first five principles of object oriented design",
        "7": "Suppose our goal is to find the area of some shape. Normally it is possible to do this without using any principles, but since our topic is to use the SOLID structure, we will design our code accordingly. Let's imagine that one of our shapes is a square and the other is a circle. The things we need to know to find their areas are the length of the side and the radius of the circle, separately for both. So we can create two classes for these. And we can create a separate class to calculate the areas and produce the output in that class, right? But there is a problem. If we want our output to be in JSON format, we will have to do it in the class we are calculating in because that class provides our output. However, this is against the first of the SOLID principles. Because the first principle says that \"a class should serve only one purpose or have only one task in order to do a job\". Therefore, if we make another class, different from the class where the calculations are done, where the output is produced either in JSON format or in HTML format, we fulfill the first principle.",
        "8": "As a result, shapes are entered. Then the areas are calculated, summed and output. All operations are performed with different classes. Each class or module has a different task in this way. ",
        "9": "Our second principle is the \"Open-Closed Principle\".  This principle states that \"a class can be extended, but the class itself cannot be changed\". Let's continue with our previous example. Let's say the user enters different shapes, i.e. data that requires different calculations, into the class for area calculations. What we normally do here is to make changes in that class by opening new if/else statements. But the second principle says, don't create every new change in this class. Don't change the content of the class. And do these mathematical operations as methods in the classes where the shapes are located. After doing this, we have the following problem. How can we know the existence of the method that will come from the shape class we will use in the class we are calculating?  Here we need to use the concept of interface. We say \"this shape class implements this interface\" by means of an interface to the method of the field calculation that we will do in the class where the shapes are located.  In this way we can check if our shape classes are instances of our interface and if it does not implement it, we can make that interface give an error message.",
        "10": "Our third principle is the \"Liskov Substitution Principle\".  It says that \"every subclass or derived class must be substitutable for its parent class\".  A quick summary and then let's continue:",

Properties to calculate the area and functions with mathematical equations to calculate the areas. We calculated the areas in a different class with these equations and since we cannot normally query whether there is such a method in the class that the user entered, we used an interface. We said that each shape should implement that interface, that is, implement/use it. And then produce our outputs in a different class. In this way, we have achieved the first two principles.",
        "12": "Let's say we are going to calculate the volume now.  And for that, let's say we extend the class that we use for area calculation. After all, we know that area is also required for volume calculation.  But after doing this calculation, we may encounter an error like \"error: array to string conversion\" in our output. Here we can get rid of this error message by making a change in the last class we created and get our output as an integer value instead of an array. This change we made can be given as an example of Liskov's change principle (Obviously they have given it, I'm saying it right now. Because I haven't done any research to confirm this from different sources yet).",
        "13": "The fourth principle is the \"Interface Segregation Principle\".  This principle states that \"the client should not be exposed to methods that it will not use or implement interfaces that it has nothing to do with and does not use\".  The interface we created before only had area calculation for 2D shapes. Let's say we will calculate the volume for 3D objects/shapes.  But shapes like squares don't have volume, so we will have to explicitly impose this interface on the classes of 2D shapes. This is where the principle of interface separation comes into play.  So let's create a separate interface to calculate the volume of 3D objects. In this way, while trying to calculate both volume and area in a single interface, let's not impose the same interface on shapes that have no area. Because the volume calculation method in that interface is not available for them. There is one more improvement on top of this. The process of combining or managing two separate interfaces in a single interface is applied. So we can think of it as using a single API. For example, if there is a calculate function in this interface, we can manage both the area calculation and the volume calculation through this function.",
        "14": "The fifth principle is the \"Dependency Inversion Principle\". This principle says that \"the 'entities' in our code, such as classes and modules, must be abstracted as opposed to concretized.\" This means the following: High level modules do not have to depend on low level modules and you should abstract them from each other.  Here's why:",
        "15": "Let's have a class called password reminder, and let this class connect to the database through a different class. The class that connects to the database is called low level and the class for remembering passwords is called high level.  The reason why they are named like this: The class where execution is done with a tool is called high level, and the tool that exists for execution is called low level. Let's continue. Let's imagine that our database is a MYSQL server and the connection is made to MySQL.  If one day we want to change the database engine, we will also have to change the password recall class.  This would be against the \"open-closed\" structure.  The idea is that the high level class should be as abstracted as possible, with as little dependency on the low level as possible. In our example, the low level server connecting to mysql or another database engine should not affect the high level class. Again, the interface is used for this. The class that we will create the MySQL connection implements the interface. This way we can use it in the high level class. In this way, high level and low level classes are abstracted from each other.",

Although I think it is sufficient, I will attempt an illustration of my own after a summary. The analogy may fail, but I thought it would be fun to think about it. First, let's summarize SOLID:",
        "19": "Although SOLID structure is used for OOP, it can also be adapted to functional programming. Yes, we will consider this structure for our object-class structures, but like the REST API concept, it is useful to consider it as a set of ideas that we should pay attention to when writing our code, no matter how we call it \"belief, philosophy, conceptual design, fictional design models created for optimized results, design pattern, architecture\".",
        "20": "The first principle says that each module should have one job and be good at it.  Modules should have one job, not different goals or different roles. Like \"Make the best thing you can\".  For example, if Demet Akalın's job is to sing, it would be absurd to ask this object (class or module or entity in general), i.e. Demet Akalın, to represent Turkey in the Tokyo Olympics and compete in the 200 meters breaststroke. So her job should be one. She should do it best.",
        "21": "The second principle says that our modules should not be modified all the time, but they should be extensible.  One reason for this is that we don't depend on the author of the class. Or from another point of view, if we have a code and we open it to a 3rd party user, we want the user not to make any changes to our class. We want the user to access only the areas we want, to play with it as much as we allow, to extend things. Here again, we can bring Demet Akalın into play. Now we said that this woman, this object, this being should only sing. The people who should go swimming in the Olympics are the competent athletes. Now we say that Demet Akalın should do other things. But now let's think about how we can connect this with coding. Normally, in the open-closed principle, let's consider other classes other than the Demet Akalın class. For example, we can give our swimmer as an example. They both have different methods and occupations. Let's say I put both of them in a restaurant. Both of them will eat. And in their properties (by default) they also have the ability to eat and drink something.  The eating speed, the way these people eat, the way they talk while eating, their attitude to the waiter are all separate methods. And we can create a different class where these methods are collected. So this can be a class with behaviors. So let the name of this class be the book of deeds. Here, in everyone's book of deeds, operations are performed and separate results are obtained, and all of them are collected and saved somewhere.  Now each operation should be in different classes according to the first principle so that it fits SOLID. Where we do our mathematical operations in this book of deeds, we only need to return the data and return the outputs numerically or by keeping them in an array. But the calculation methods used for the calculations of people like Demet Akalın, Snopp Dogg, Ricky Martin, Jesus Christ, Buğra, Ömer Hayyam are different. Yes, they are all called calculations, but they are all calculated differently. Therefore, in this class, we only use the methods from the related classes and do our calculation. The divine formulas evaluating Demet Akalın are different, the swimmer's are different. Well, is there a problem? Now we know that unborn babies go directly to heaven, which can be given as an example. So we can say they don't have a method. They have the right of direct passage without processing.  But in this calculation class, how do we include unborn babies, martyrs or \"good people\" in many other religions in the calculation. If they don't have methods and we try to calculate them, we may get a fatal error. That's why we say that there are some same interfaces that every human uses. They all eat, they all sleep, they all are born and die, they all lie or cry (at least once). We can collect all these in one interface. But the methods in this interface must be suitable for all of them. A person who does not use a method in that interface will directly terminate the system with a fatal error.  As a result, even if I go on too long, I should come to this point: it is much better for us to use an interface and separate this process instead of trying to define the implementation of each method in the class where the calculations are made differently, changing it many times and causing the system to give errors that can have bad consequences.",
        "22": "Liskov summarizes in his third principle: If something behaves in the same way as something else, you should be able to change it. In object class structure, more so in inheritance logic, we look at it like this: A child takes a property of the parent. And it can change it on its own. For example, Demet Akalın's father may be a very bad alcoholic, but Demet Akalın may only drink a glass of whiskey every night. She doesn't have to maintain the whole genetic or learned/behavioral heritage. But she always has to carry its traces. Even if Demet Akalın wants to go and live in foreign countries one day and thinks that she would be very happy, she should know that she cannot escape from herself. From her past, from what she was taught.  But of course she can make small changes.",
        "23": "The fourth principle boils down to, give the client what it wants. So don't give it an interface it won't use or force it to do unnecessary things. Let's go back to Demet Akalın. If Demet Akalın is singing at a concert, she should not talk about the problems she told her psychologist about at the concert. If she is very emotional or troubled, she can write a song about it and convey her feelings to the client, that is, to her fans, but she should not give them what they do not want.",
        "24": "The fifth principle is that you should use abstraction to link high level and low level entities. The high level entity (module, class, object, whatever you call it) uses the low level entities to do its operations. And we need to abstract the low level entity a bit from the high level. In this way, we don't need to make a change in our high level entity in case of a change in the low level. Of course, interface can also be used for this structure. At least in the examples I saw, it was used in that way to abstract it. Let's say Demet Akalın has a boyfriend. And she is very dependent on him, she is fond of him, she can't live without him and she is still secretly listening to \"Join me in death\". This is very wrong. So you are Demet Akalın. If he breaks up with you, you will be very sad and you will have to change yourself to get him back. But our principle says, \"Demet, if you want to be valued in a relationship, don't give too much value.\" Think of him as no different from other men. Think like one comes and one goes and be immoral (according to who and according to what). In this way, you won't wear out no matter who you date. You'll get used to it quickly and accept it.\".",

Since I tried to explain what I understood about SOLID both yesterday and during the day and through examples, this report is a bit more about the different things that stayed in my mind.  Why do we use all this in a nutshell? We are actually breaking down our code. We create a different object structure for each task. When we want to make changes to a certain part of our code in the later stages, we use the SOLID structure to prevent it from damaging or affecting the entire system and to make the correction process in a much better way. This of course applies to all articles of SOLID. Concepts such as clean code and agile work together with this architectural philosophy. When we use the SOLID structure, we inevitably have a much cleaner code structure.",
        "29": "The subsequent modifications to this code can be thought of as \"maintenance and extending\". If we make a change in the database engine, a high level module that will be affected by this change using the interface can easily adapt to our new system using abstraction, for example.",
        "30": "Well, we tried to understand the SOLID architecture and I think we understood as much as we could understand by reading without practicing. When I was working on SOLID today, I researched some OOP concepts because I needed to understand why we should realize a design on OOP. It was actually simple. The best result that OOP provides is related to the Encapsulation principle in its structure. When an error occurs somewhere in our code, it would be much more difficult to find where the error is if we were not using OOP, but if there is a problem with a particular object, we can say that it must be a problem with the class it is in. If my car object is broken, I can say that there is a problem with my car class and I can resolve the source of the problem. In terms of code reusability, we can add many different vehicles and their properties as child classes in our Car class. We can create a change in all of them with a change in the base class, or we can create separate methods for each car object and make them special.  Moreover, with a single \"drive\" function, we can specify a method for all car objects (that is, as instances that will be created from child classes). Or we can create it as an interface and say that every class implements this interface. We can say that the best benefit of the object/class structure is that it gives us the ability to solve problems much more efficiently (compared to architectures like top-down language-C, functional style language-Haskell or ML).  If we summarize its benefits in one sentence, we can say that it uses modular structure to solve problems in an easy way (like a jigsaw puzzle, each piece has its own place in this modular structure), provides code reusability with inheritance, provides flexibility with polymorphism, and of course provides the ability to solve problems efficiently.",

It was good while reading SOLID, I thought I understood it for the most part, but when it came to practice, I couldn't do it the way I wanted. At least I say I tried. Of course, it seemed easy when a mystery was solved again. In fact, if I created the inheritance structure, my code would almost be there, but it never occurred to me to think of creating ineritance in that way. Because if there is a function in the parent and the child doesn't change it and use it, I thought what is the need for this relation, but I realized that it can both change it and use it as it is in the parent.",

Interface is there to define the mandatory methods that other developers must have in the classes they will produce when they will work in the system you produce. Abstract class, on the other hand, is and should be used to make the developers who will work in your system use some abstract methods and provide them with some base methods when they create their child classes. Both have their pros and cons. The reasons for preference will also vary depending on what kind of structure will be built. There is no such thing as you should definitely use interface or abstract. It may vary according to the project and the requirements of the system. As we know, every class that will implement the interface must use every method in the interface. They can be implemented by classes more than once. They can also be used by completely different and unrelated classes.

A web application can support different rendering engines at the same time only if its classes are independent of the rendering engine's concrete classes. Therefore, you have to communicate with the app's objects only using their abstract interfaces. Your code should not directly create template objects, but assign special factory objects for their creation. Finally, your code should not depend on factory objects, but should instead work with them through the abstract factory interface. As a result, you will be able to provide the app with the factory object corresponding to one of the rendering engines. Every template created in the app will be created by the factory, and their type will match the factory's type. If you want to change the rendering engine, you will be able to pass a new factory to the client code without breaking the existing code.",

You would find your way through the mud, the darkness, the trees, the thorny grass. As an example of this analogy, a project is started in a company. After 5 years, what happens when the people who were involved in the project before are gone? It is incredibly useful to have some basic up-to-date documentation available for everyone who joins the project later. And here's the reality. If every part of a project is fully described with method and parameter names, it is difficult to maintain and sustain. Still, it is very valuable to show basic diagrams of the relationships between structures in the system. In general, no one wants to read a 50-page UML diagram with everything fully rendered.

And of course the same applies to similar situations in other parts. Then the following can be done: Go through each element of the data one by one. If there is a nestedness (in the keywords used to construct the meaning), the problem is solved if I save the position (index) of the key element in the inner part somewhere and do not use it later to construct the meaningful structure.

I will continue to look again tomorrow, unless I am given a different task. ",

At first it was hardcoded as you said, and after I corrected it, it was close to the logic you told us, but there was a difference. Afterwards, while I was doing some research on what Selenium is, I came across a stack overflow page about what a gargabe collector is from the links I used to look at. I did a little bit of research on it and took notes. I can say that I understood what it does in the most superficial way. Then I went back to the PDF you told us to look at in our free time and read it. After 8pm I went back to task 2 and tried to fix my problems with opening parentheses. Unfortunately, unfortunately, I still have problems with it. I think I've done it, then I test it in a few different ways and I get unwanted results again. I always feel that I'm very close to the solution but I can't reach it. Maybe I need to establish cause and effect relationships better and examine the functioning of the program better rather than trusting my feelings. ",

After a while I focused more on the solution rather than dealing with it. I can make improvements again afterwards. As far as I tested, there is no problem in opening and closing parentheses except the parenthesis of the mysql function. Afterwards, when I felt that I was having a hard time developing new things and my productivity was decreasing, I redirected my attention to the PDF you told us to read in our free time. There was an example of how to find the greatest common divisor. A solution was presented centuries ago with the algorithm developed by Euclid. I searched for similar mathematical examples on the internet and became even more fascinated. I finished the introductory parts where the most basic information about programming and programming languages were given. Now the book switched to C language and I stayed there. I will continue to study and learn the topics in that PDF in my spare time.",

I looked at many of the examples, but I chose not to look at the ones that seemed like a waste of time. I was actually a bit surprised when I was looking at C because we have already learned PHP and Javascript in the parts we have seen so far. The reason was this: for example, memory management is delegated to the user using pointers. We had never seen anything like this in PHP and Javascript, or I was surprised to see the enumeration part. Although there are ways to do this in PHP and Javascript, in C it was more detailed and emphasized. And object-class relationships were the most emphasized topics until now. However, even though polymorphism and inheritance can be applied in C (according to what I read in stack overflow), since it is a block structured language (I don't fully understand the meaning of this yet), the implementation of OOP seemed a bit difficult. I still have some question marks in my mind (maybe because I'm ignorant of the subject): for example, I read that languages like Python and Java work by taking the positive aspects of both compilation and interpretation. If such a thing is possible, I'm a bit surprised why there are languages that only work with compilation or interpretation. But instead of simply asking google for the answer, I wanted to keep it as a question mark and think about it.",

In the demos I saw on their site, I saw that something could be developed client-side using the class structure (with lots of divs and other elements in it), and that I encountered different ways of using javascript, and I was happy for some reason.",

And I left it there because I thought I could figure out the logic of it a little bit, I thought I could do something with it. But the query builder stayed where we left it last week. Not finishing it is still in the back of my mind. But it seemed like it would take a little bit more time to finish it completely. But thanks to those tasks, I was able to gain different perspectives every time I faced a problem. Trying to bring solutions to the problems I could find and bringing them to some of them was also very satisfying.

You must not have understood it.\" Today, when I was looking at that PDF, I said to myself a lot, \"OK, I solved it\" a lot. I felt like I was just reinforcing my knowledge in many places. When I saw the differences in syntax, the differences in the way entities are used, and the differences in interpreted languages in C related topics, I did some research on them. I think I may have said that because I haven't tried to write a code in C, but if I talk about the parts I saw, I think I can handle it even if it takes a little time. That's all for today.",

I can't say I examined it because I couldn't find a beautiful site that I could take as an example. The problem given was this: To prepare a page dedicated to people who will apply for a reseller and a printer system. There should be one page for both cases. I thought that having two different tabs on one page would reduce the complexity and length of the page. By default one tab should be open at the beginning. Since the publisher is already quite computer literate, I thought the dealer system should be the default. So what should be in the content? The individual who will apply to become a dealer should somehow send us their information. For this, we can give a contact address or we can get the data we want from the user via a form. Well, if the user wants to become a dealer, if he/she has come to this link, wouldn't it be good to convince him/her with a little fancy language about why he/she should choose it? I think so. That's why I thought it would be good to present some of the basic features of the site (company) numerically (how many years in the sector, how many companies are authorized dealers, the general volume of the products of the authorized dealers in the sector, etc.). In summary, I could think of two things: To convince the user and to make them contact us with peace of mind and willingness.",

I got as far as the Big O notation. Even though I thought \"I'm wasting time by reading the introduction\", it was nice to read the history of the computer, the history of computing by machine. From Charles Babbage to Alan Turing, from John Mauchly's efforts and the many times his ideas were stolen or appropriated, to Apple, to Ada Lovelace breaking my sexist perception that the first programmer in history was always a man. I think if I keep writing, the report might stop being a report, because then I will go on to say that Ada Lovelace was Lord Byron's daughter, that Lord Byron swam across the Dardanelles with a crippled leg, that she wrote Don Juan, and that Albert Camus's inferences about Don Juan in The Myth of Sisyphus.

And I really didn't realize how time was passing and how much time had passed. Towards the end of the day, I looked at different CSS examples again. For example, I didn't know that there are online formatters that convert SCSS to CSS. Many beautiful designs on Codepen used SCSS, but I was skipping them directly, not using them and not examining them carefully. Now I've learned a shortcut for it too if it will be useful to me.

The second design is still at this stage towards the end of the day: \"Drawing sketches in a notebook\". If the goal was just to be fast, it could be done with very little thought. If the goal was to create a perfect look, it would take a long time but a pretty good design could be created. But I think the goal is to keep the balance. So the trade-off between time and quality is a natural one. And I attribute your asking us for a second design to two things: you want us to do better or you want us to look at it from different angles.

This week I aim to finish the simple algorithms in the introduction part of the book. If it is done quickly, I will continue with the second part (I think I will pass and keep moving forward). I realized something interesting: In the Egyptian number system, there are numbers \"1,10,100,1000, even 1 million\". I thought, what could the Egyptians have done in their time to use 1,000,000? Of course, they were very advanced in areas such as pyramids (engineering), health, astronomy. There could have even been things related to the tax system and military service. But if I lived 3000 years ago, I would never have used the number 1 million in a desert. Maybe they never used such a number, but for them it was like our expressions \"infinite or indefinite\". Although this fantastic thought of mine can be demolished by the existence of around 900,000 manuscripts in the Library of Alexandria. If they built a library that houses so many books and in which giants like Euclid, Archimedes and Ptolemy worked, they definitely needed and used that number somewhere.",

Each iteration has its own analysis, design, implementation, and testing. At the end of each iteration, customer input is received. In other words, that iteration is explained to the customer and the customer returns. If the customer does not like or accept that iteration, only that part is corrected again. In this way, the process can be completed with much less loss compared to the waterfall model.",

The reason is that it is actually contrary to the existence of Agile.",

        "12": "At the beginning of the day, I was looking at converting the use case into a class diagram, and then I was thinking about the communication of objects over and over and over again, and I started to come up with my own outlandish ideas. Objects were communicating in pairs and these relationships were provided by methods. Since the objects were created in relation to contemporary life (not in software, of course), I thought, why does an object need another object to touch it for messaging? In a movie whose trailer was shown in the movie theater today, there was a saying \"The one you seek is the one who seeks you\" (maybe we shouldn't take Sufism as an example in this regard, but I wanted to add it when I thought of it). In order for me to put one object in contact with another, it has to seek it. The other object is waiting to be sought. It's a bit like \"it was already being searched for\", but that's how it is. I thought what would happen if a third object listened to the other objects talking, that is, an object that listens to two or more objects talking. Objects communicate only when they are called. It's like a snake that doesn't touch me. Actually, this may be the purpose in the current use. I think the opposite situation (objects that hear everything and communicate) is in the procedural method. I dreamed too much unnecessary dreams, I felt like it was going nowhere. Let me end this paragraph by saying that at least dreaming is also important.",
        "13": "And then I looked at Actor Model, and Alan Key has a Quora account and he answers a lot of questions there. When I saw this, I was very impressed because he became one of the heroes of fairy tales in my eyes. He mentioned that Actor Model is actually not much different from OOP. In fact, since the pure object oriented logic that was first created turned a little more class oriented afterwards; he said that Actor Model is more similar to pure OOP than the OOP currently used. The reason is that it focuses on messaging as far as I understand. I understood the concurrency advantage, but since I haven't seen it in practice, I only grasped it logically. Apart from that, I guess Actor Model can also be used in PHP. So I thought why Actor Model is not used now instead of OOP. There were answers I found. But I didn't fully understand. The only thing I can relate it to is that it might be similar to why SmallTalk is not used now. Of course it is used, by the way, discrete (like microservice. I only know it as a concept. I have no idea of the details) especially for systems. But I realized that it is not very common.",

Especially when creating the diagrams, they seem to have evolved. Because they really evolved. I always tried to try out the new things I learned in the new parts I created. Some of the classes may have had insufficient attributes, some of them may have been redundant. When I started to think about these things enough, I was starting to get into programming logic a lot, so I left it a bit more superficial.",
        "18": "At the end of the day, I thought about English. I also lack a lot in speaking. The reason for this is that I have trouble finding words when speaking a foreign language and I think I also lack self-confidence in this particular subject. Because while I feel very comfortable talking to a foreigner, I don't enjoy speaking a foreign language with a Turkish person at all. Because I feel like he/she will always look for something wrong with me and that's why I prefer not to speak unless he/she is a humble normal person. Why did I mention English? The advice at the core of speaking English is not to think in Turkish and to try to speak and think in English without translation in daily life. I always give up on this because I don't know the word meanings of the things I encounter in daily life. How can this be solved? It can be done by thinking about the words and sentences that are frequently used in daily life and learning those words. Diagrams were created for communication between objects. I assumed that I could create a diagram for this too. I will say the sentence to the machine in Turkish and it will give me the English equivalent. For example, Cortana or Siri is spoken in a language, yes. But what if the machine responded to my sentence in English? What if it specifically specified those words to me and tried to make me speak. In a way, the machine would be my English teacher. Like Elsa, it could present my mispronunciations to me as statistics. She could send me a text of our conversations. I could read it if I wanted to. I'm talking about different technologies here, all in one place. Maybe there is such a thing and I don't know about it. In short, I just thought of an application that could help me think and speak in English. It could provide the translation part with an API related to translate. But artificial intelligence would come into play for things like him asking me, which I don't know anything about. Still, it seemed like something I could think about.",

Afterwards, I saw an article on MDN about publishing a web page and it talked about creating a static web page on Github. From an article on Medium, I learned that this page can be provided with a database using the Firebase API. The static site normally only has Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I will try to pull the information I get from the user into the database using Javascript with the help of the API. If I can do it, I think this can be my backyard or garage. At least I think I will have learned how to use the API, how to get the data to the NoSql database and how to process it, what GIT is and how to use it, how to create a project on Github and how to update the project instantly with GIT or Github Desktop. I think I will look at this over the weekend when I am free. I looked at GIT a little bit today, but I found it confusing at first because I'm new to it. So Github Desktop is very simple to start with, so I used it to simplify project updating. Actually, there are solutions with Firebase for both mobile app development, hosting and database, but for now I want to solve the database part. First note: I installed GIT and Github Desktop on my own computer. I could have done without it, but for learning purposes. Second note: There is another site called Heroku that does something similar to what Firebase does but it can cause some problems:",

Yes, I am creating a class diagram, but the connections between them are so incomplete that I am aware of it myself. For example, I have not yet written what type the input and output parameters will be.

I thought, why not a game inspired by the naval wars of the Ottoman Empire and the states of the period? And I was surprised by the ideas the app gave me. It told me about possible enemies, alliances, regions to fight in (such as the Mediterranean, Istanbul axis, North African coasts), periods in which the game could take place (even modern Turkey after the second world war was included), difficulty levels, attacks from near land to the warship or from the aircraft carrier to the land. It was like the AI was playing a game of whack-a-mole. It was blindfolded and I just directed it to \"hot and cold\", but there was a problem. I think it was just taking inspiration from the games that had already been made and published. Because I wanted to develop a scenario like this but he always suggested the opposite arguments. The scenario I wanted to create was: \"What if Adolf Hitler had won?\". For example, it would have given me pleasure to play the game or read and watch the fiction.

Because it can seriously use existing scenarios to create a complex product. It can manipulate us with its fictionalized stories. And they proved this with dating apps that it can be a person of the opposite sex. Our primitive relatives used hand tools to break down food, extract it from parts of the hive they couldn't reach, use fire, use different animals for transportation and communication because they themselves weren't fast enough, and there are so many other things. Now, because we don't think our intelligence is enough in some areas, we want to use something perhaps more intelligent for us.

        "32": "I remember when we first looked at what object-oriented programming was, and you expected something about products and categories. You wanted us to build an OOP based structure where categories and products were related to each other. At that time, I remember using interfaces everywhere because I had just learned about interfaces. In addition, there was only inheritance. And later, when I was working on SOLID, a mistake I made in that work was engraved in my mind: \"Interface Segregation Principle\". It was about an object that implements an interface should use its methods. When there were branches and branches in inheritance, some objects had to implement methods that they would not use. And that's why ISP was the rule I thought I understood the fastest in SOLID.",

Which I really felt that I was learning. Then I studied design patterns. Learning design patterns in 1 week was like learning regex in 1 day. When I read it, when I looked at the examples, I thought I understood it, but I felt that I had forgotten it because I didn't encounter it in practice and assimilate it.

There is a relationship of ownership and part-whole. The Earth does not depend on the mountain or the human being for its existence. So there is no \"dependency\" here for the world. There is \"association\" in the most general sense. We can give the moon as a distinctive example for association. The Earth can use the Moon satellite to maintain the tides in the ocean object it possesses. Here, \"use\" is emphasized rather than ownership. This is also an accosication. Man is a part of the earth, but man can exist outside the earth object (he can live on different planets and satellites when appropriate conditions are met). The mountain cannot exist outside the earth. There is such a difference between Earth-human and Earth-mountain, even though the Earth has both. The Earth-human relationship is an aggregation relationship whose superset is asscociation. The Earth-mountain relation is a composition relation whose superset is association. Since the example would be inefficient if we expanded these lines of thought, we can grasp the concept from this narrow framework. ",

Man is a primate, an animal, a creature, a concrete being. All of them can inherit common human characteristics and procedures. The problem with inheritance is that it is like steel. It does not stretch easily, it is hard to shape by beating. That's why the GoF book says \"prefer composition over inheritance\". It doesn't mean make a composition relation everywhere you see it. Prefer composition because it is easier to change the behavior of the object using dependency injection/setter. In inheritance, it is not possible to derive objects from more than one type (at least in most software languages) and it is coupled. Therefore, the use of interfaces and abstract classes becomes important. If I go into SOLID principles, which are complementary to each other in this article, the topic will get longer. Inheritance is like steel, composition is like copper. It is easier to forge, process, shape and modify. In order to use Inheritance like copper, it is necessary to know SOLID principles and pay attention to these principles during the design phase of classes. In short, the polymorphism provided in the OCP, Liskov, ISP principles of SOLID is the most important issue in this flexibility.",

Or at least I thought that they should be very similar. When designing the payment system, there were very interrelated structures. Interface-abstract class usage was mandatory. But I couldn't figure out where and how many relationships there were. Then I looked at what design patterns people had used before in payment. I generally encountered factory method, strategy and facade patterns. There were many similar examples of using simple factory and strategy pattern together, especially in both authentication and checkout. Afterwards, I spent most of the day again understanding these design patterns and theoretically designing how I could fit them into my own system. While looking at the strategy pattern, the open-closed principle directly caught my eye. It seemed like its whole purpose was to provide it. I didn't really find much difference with Factory. Although they mentioned a lot of differences in stack overflow, I haven't grasped it yet. The clearest thought I saw was that the payment methods should have a common structure and instead of using them all with a hardcoded structure, we should follow OCP and not update the old parts of the system when we add or delete a new payment method. I thought just a simple factory design pattern would be enough and I started to implement it. It's not finished yet. The reason I came to the last conclusion may be because I couldn't understand the difference between Factory-Strategy patterns.

There are harmful aspects such as a link can go to a spammy lyre site, it can narrow our traffic volume. So why didn't Donanım Haber use the nofollow tag? It tells Google that this link is sponsored.

Most probably by using the get method from the incoming link and maybe with the help of regex, the existing code can be retrieved, its correctness can be questioned and then the necessary actions can be taken).

Model=> Database relationships, the part that contains the main logic of the system, the part we are actually interested in right now.

If we want to turn down the volume, change the channel, we first manipulate the reference. It in turn modifies the object. When you move around the room you still control the object with the reference. You move around with the reference with you, but not the TV. Also, the reference can be on its own without the TV. Just because you have a reference does not mean that there is an object to which it is attached.",

I read that in Objective-C every class is an object, every class is an object. But since these classes are objects, they have to derive from a different class and this class is called metaclass. Just like an object is the expression of an ordinary instance, a metaclass is the expression of a class object (I didn't know anything about it, but since I said it by referring to those who do, I included plenty of tenses).",

But I encountered the mail SMTP server error many times and couldn't find a solution. The error is probably caused by the TLS-SSL port.

Therefore, how to get out of the business without much confusion and how to make a good design was thought and tried to be created today.

I learned what autoloader is, how it works, and then I needed to understand how the directory structure of the files should be. There was no single truth about this on the internet.

The author talked a lot about the benefits of grouping directories according to feature. For example, when a developer looks at the directory, they can quickly get an idea of what the application is doing. It is actually much more organized code generation. One of the main details in the code we wrote (or rather you wrote) was also in this article: \"Separate general purpose code and domain code\". It was mentioned to separate core and classes. Lava could come to us from the core of the earth. But we couldn't go down to the core. The sun would warm us, give us life. But we didn't add anything to the sun, the sun didn't need us (who knows?).

Let's imagine we are writing a button component. On every page where a button is used, we can use the same component instead of writing code for the button over and over again. We can also create different variations of the same component. By using different variations of the same button component, we get a consistent design (Unrelated and overlapping buttons on each page will provide a dirty and inconsistent look. This should not be the unique design of the application that stays in the memory).",

As with web project architecture, there is no single right or wrong here, and everyone's best practice was their own approach. Two designs in particular were frequently mentioned:",
        "7": "There was a project architecture where components were built with an atomic structure (atom-molecule-organism-template-page). Here atoms were the smallest building block components that could not be broken down into smaller groups. Molecules were a group of atoms that did one thing. It can be thought of as a form field. Organism was a structure made up of molecules that made up the more complex part of the app.  Template, as the name suggests, was the layout, the template of a page (Illustration: The template of an object is the class. The page is the instance of the template). Another common design was the Container/Component concept. The logic was to make components as stateless as possible and see them as \"dump\". Container was acting as both a controller and the page itself. There have been many disadvantages of this issue in the past and now there are optimized solutions for it (applying command pattern from design patterns, developing with the help of hooks, etc.), but since there are different applications and it's late, I think I'll talk about it later. But in the reference sources where atomic design is explained, issues such as the container/component concept is not scalable, it is not clear what it does (is it a page or a statful component acting like a controller) are mentioned and it is said that there is no need to use it. On the gray side, both of them have a lot of users and it would be useful to create a design according to which is most useful for us and which will cause less problems in the future. The options can be not only two but a completely different structure. ",

It is of course useful to read other people's problems and the solutions developed, but it may not be easy to understand that problem without having a problem myself (it can be thought of as empathizing: \"hmm yes, I have faced this problem too, and the solutions were/are like this\").

One of the problems that took me a while: since scrollView loads all the resources on the page directly, I avoided using it and adopted Flatlist (since it does lazy initialization on the web by default). But I couldn't create the scroll due to a problem I can't figure out where it originated from. I'll look at it again. Then I was encountering an error in parameter passing during navigation. I encountered such a problem because I didn't know object destructuring well and I used copy-paste code incorrectly. I fixed it with your help and now the code seems to be working normally. But the components don't use any state (it is used only in the navigation related part, but it is a property of the library's own object). Since the state is not kept, naturally there is no need for a context. After doing the basic operations, I think I can also make improvements.

Everything was exactly the same with the same folder structures, the same dependencies. I tried to understand it because I thought it was written with both context, pulling data from api, lots of callbacks, and a nice logic that looks simple. Honestly, I understood what was done in that code in general, but there were some parts that were not understood. Tomorrow morning, I will look at the parts that are not understood in that example (especially useCallback and useEffect are not fully understood, I will understand it). In React Native, I used to think that it is only a fronend because there is only the Css JavaScript side, but as far as I understand, it also includes the controller part. As far as I understand, navigation, data transmission (state management), style are the most general areas that are dealt with. In general terms, when I think about it, I think what's wrong with it, but things may not be that much.

It doesn't look like a very nice structure, but it provides the solution. It's a different perspective. I don't think that what we do is magic, but sometimes it feels magical. I don't think this is wrong.

Although my hand trembled at first with the thought that I would break it even more, then I reached the solution with the motto \"those who are afraid have no children\" and with caution. Then there was the problem of converting pages into file and folder structure. When I did research on this topic on the web, it was generally advised to establish a file-folder organization by classifying by feature (group by feature, or group by archetype) rather than by archetype.

You explained it to me well and corrected my incorrect code on the same topic before. The reason why I had difficulty in reaching the solution today was because I didn't think my way to the solution thoroughly and systematically. I was too busy thinking about how to make the reducer asynchronous or how to use an asynchronous function in the reducer, whereas if I had given the dispatch function that triggers the reducer as a callback to the asynchronous function I was using, the problem would have been fixed.

So I can change the contents of the box. Someone else can also change the contents of the box. So the box is actually something that is shared. So in the simplest sense, thinking in the old way, everything looks like pass by reference (call by sharing, alias, etc.). But it is not. Let's come to why it is not:  if it was pass by reference, obj2 should have changed. But there was no change. Why is that? We shared the box with the function. Here you can do whatever you want with this box. And what did it do? It didn't use the box we gave it at all. Instead it created a different object and told the variable that referenced our box, \"Now you reference this new object, leave the box that came to us\". So there was no change in obj2.

When we multiplied it by ten (assignment), the value we equalized was not itself. It was a different box. It was 100.

        "3": "Apart from that, today I looked at the Laravel documentation in general. I saw how cross site request forguery can be blocked and its place in mvc. When I came across Blade template engine while looking at the View section, I remembered ofEngine (a template engine) and paid more attention. I couldn't examine it very carefully because the code about Blade in Laravel was a bit too complicated, but I think I understand what the template engine does and how it works at the most basic level.",
        "4": "In addition, the pleasure of being able to read language-independent code is something else. Of course, I'm not very good, but it can be self-satisfying to see that I'm not ignorant in my own way.",

        "6": "I can't say that I learned anything new today that opened my horizons a lot. Mentally it was pretty quiet. I looked at Blade's syntax again. I had read that there is template inheritance, but today I was able to see what it is in practice. I came across alternatives to Blade, Laravel, MVC quite often while researching the subject. Part of me says you shouldn't reinvent the wheel, the other part of me says you should do it to learn the logic of the business, to prove yourself. But the truth is this: let's think of any existing MVC framework as a tank. If I need a tank, I can use it directly. But if I need an airplane or a Ferrari, I should use them, if not, I should create them.",
        "7": "I also had the self-awareness program in the back of my mind all day long. I am glad you showed it to me. I will probably work on it tomorrow. The topics I am curious about and the things I want to do (as a side project or as something I need to add to myself) have become quite a lot. I need to finish the Algorithms book, I need to assimilate it, I need to finish it. I want to spend time thinking about what a self-aware program can do, how a project could be developed on it. Since I have never mastered what happens at the junction of software and hardware, I want to learn that part clearly. I have also heard a lot about David Malan's CS50 course, but I have never started it. I want to spend time on that too. Beyond that, I need to reinforce, learn, keep fresh my own topics (web, even mobile specific) to do my best in my own work. There is so much to do. So I am happy.",

        "9": "Today was like a tribute to the masters. First of all, my respect for Martin Fowler grew even more because whatever topic I looked at in software architecture, his writings were always the foundation. Even though I thought I had found something new today (accessing my credit card from my phone with NFC), I learned that it had already been worked on, and I was impressed that you had done it years and years ago.",
        "10": "The subject I was working on today was ORM. Two architectures were used in ORM. Active record and data mapper architectures. I should not forget that ORM actually consists of two parts. \"data abstraction layer\" where SQL queries are abstracted and \"data access layer\" which consists of active record or data mapper.  Both have their advantages and disadvantages, but I learned that which one to use depends on the situation. I actually likened it to a topic. Which is the weakest piece in chess? There are actually two options: ",

        "14": "When I came home, I was browsing google services and I came across google finance. It was just like any other finance application, even more inadequate. Again, maybe thousands or hundreds of thousands of people have thought about this, but here's what came to my mind: There are a lot of charts on currencies, on valuable papers in the stock market. The predictability of these charts is actually quite low. If it were high, everybody would be rich (and it's impossible for everybody to be rich). I thought if there was a program that could predict the volatility in the value of an asset, if there was a smart bot that could play the stock market accordingly. But for this bot to be smart, it would need to have the mindset of a person who wins at the stock market (the heuristics it often uses). I think it would have to have the ability to follow and analyze the news, or read and predict what the charts mean, if they mean anything. Could our intelligent bot even manipulate? After all, the whole economic system, even human relationships, are based on trust and faith. It seemed like an intelligent bot could do what a human could do. I think I will think about it again.",
        "15": "Day 154",
        "16": "Today I used an ORM tool (TypeORM) in node.js to connect to the database and make queries. I personally felt that using ORM actually makes things much easier once you get used to it. If I was doing a more individual or small-scale application, I wouldn't immediately look for an ORM library with the prejudice that I should use ORM. I would either use an ORM library or a query builder that would work for me. But I think it is necessary for a large-scale application. One of the reasons why I think so is that ORM is based on separation of concerns, just like the reason for the existence of MVC. In the current project, I can fulfill my needs by writing SQL queries, but in the future, when dozens of developers are working on the project, the abstraction and single job ownership principle of ORM will make it easier for them and the project manager (whoever is involved). The only problem with ORM as I understand it is that it can cause performance issues as the project develops. Most popular ORMs have stated that they have developed their own solutions for this. But I am not very familiar with this issue yet. ",
        "17": "Day 155",
        "18": "Today I took a look at TypeORM again and then looked at the syntax of Sequlize and how it is used. I found that they are very similar, but of course there are many differences. For example, in one the main character is Typescript while in the other it is Javascript. Or one has Active Record and Data Mapper Pattern options while the other only has Active record. The use cases involving relationships between objects (data models-database tables) were very similar.",
        "19": "Then I looked at how to write queries using keywords in sql such as group by, having, subquery, join in TypeORM and tried to adapt it to my own situation. It took a little long because I was a beginner. I think if I practice a little bit, it will fit quite well because it doesn't seem to be a problem to understand the logic.",

        "23": "At first I was going to continue with TypeORM. Even though the project I created yesterday worked fine, I gave up on TypeORM because of the typescript itself, the fact that the concepts were getting more and more complex and I was too dependent on the documentation (actually this was not a problem, the problem was that it was not easy to find what I was looking for in the documentation), the fact that ORM itself gives a lot of options, but after a while the use of these options could get a bit more complicated (probably due to my inexperience). Because ORM did not make my work easier, it took a lot of my time like learning a new bird.",
        "24": "I started using Sequalize right away. It was much simpler to use and didn't have a complicated syntax (at least from what I've seen and used). Especially the fact that it was Javascript, that the help messages were very detailed and allowed to speed up the process, and that the functions and options it provided were very useful. I used that ORM today.",

        "26": "I think I can fulfill the given task. When I looked at the web-socket concept in detail for the first time, I had a hard time understanding it at first. Obviously, if I take a cursory look and copy paste, of course something can be done, but I'm trying to digest it thoroughly. I guess that's why I'm a little slow. But I think I'm doing well anyway.",
        "27": "It took me a while to get used to the concept of sockets, since I was so used to a stateless protocol (HTTP) and everything was based on that logic. It's still not quite there yet, but by the end of the day, at least I understood a little bit how it works.",

On the contrary, I felt that I learned more than yesterday, through my own efforts and your leverage of course.  I am aware that it is not a report full of information and I feel uncomfortable with that. But I will still send this content-less report and I can embellish it by noting the notes taken. This is not a bad thing if those embellishments add something to it. Nevertheless, this is the report for today. I don't think it will be repeated. With respect and love.",

Of course, I think I can run a sample application on the computer, but I think what I am looking for is the perfect thing. And what I am trying to do is the perfect thing. I expect a lot more than my own level, and because of this expectation, I postpone a little bit what I should do, starting from the most basic logic in solving the problem and growing the idea. I think I want to look at other people's grown ideas and grow my own ideas in the same way or get inspired. Or I'm afraid of doing it wrong and that's why I don't do it right. But being afraid of doing wrong is a wrong thought from the beginning. I should continue without getting into these thoughts. Your finance example reminded me of the art of meeting unlimited needs with limited resources. It was a really good definition.",

Yes, I can simply redirect a user who sends a request to a server to a different server, and I can send a few necessary parameters while doing that redirection. But when I send these parameters to the authorization-verification server and redirect the user to communicate with that server, I can't hide these parameters yet. And that was my main sticking point today. Of course, it can be overcome very easily, but I haven't found a solution to this problem yet. Maybe it's not a problem for now.",

Before I started the job, and even for a few years, I thought I was quite nihilistic and rational in my thinking in general. I still am, of course. It was as if I had lost my ability to dream at the age of 18 and before. In this 6.5 month period, yes, I learned a lot about software, as much as you can learn. But the thing I learned the most was to dream again. Of course, you cannot follow those dreams with inaction and apoliticism. Although I don't have any gripping dreams yet, but it is very nice to feel that I can dream again in a satisfying way. Thank you very much for that. Unfortunately, I can't contribute more than thanking you right now. I still feel like a parasite, but hopefully this situation will become desirable. I still don't listen to the machine when I talk to it, and I try to apply what I know and what I see to it and ask it to give me the results I want. This is very wrong, but I am trying to fix it."

Although I haven't thought about every part in detail, I'm trying to follow and code a scheme on how a simple authorization and verification should be done. The problem I had today I couldn't solve at the end of the day. When a server sends a request to another server with the post method and wants to get the response (using axios), it can get the response without any problem when receiving normal and ordinary variables, but it cannot get the session information. However, session information can be accessed from everywhere else on that server. Even when retrieving data from that server with the get method, the session data is simply accessed. Tomorrow morning I will refocus and try to find the main source of the problem and solve it, or alternatively I will solve it with the get method. In addition, I transferred the transitions from the redirect method provided by express to a different url on the client side in the normal way. Everywhere I use it. Despite that, it continues.",

But even though I could perform operations with a get or post request from a different domain, I could not save data to the session. I thought that if it allows me to perform operations, it allows CORS. But if I cannot add data to the session, I thought that I could not get the result I wanted because it is a precaution against CSRF. So I will look at it tomorrow morning.",

Domain A sends back the auth code with client id, client secret information in return. Here Domain B creates the necessary tokens. Why didn't it send the necessary tokens (id token, access token, refresh token etc.) directly? Because if there is a part to authorize depending on the user's permission, it is ensured that the user knows the scopes that the site wants. This does not need to be in the current system, but I added it this way because there are examples I have seen (can be deleted or improved). Then, Domain A uses the id token to see the user information (the id token is sent if Domain A has specified it in the scope for authorization (as used in openid)). The access token is only used to access the areas where authorization is available (For example, when we want to get data from different source servers, we can see what our authorizations are when we want to access those resources. Originally, Domain A should not be able to read and understand the access token. To ensure this, instead of using a symmetric algorithm like hs256, an asymmetric algorithm like rs256 can be preferred. Actually, it may not, it is a matter of preference as far as I understand). Today I finally created the tokens as JWT tokens and they can be read both in Domain A and Domain B with client secret. The problem is that when I send the tokens from Domain B to Domain A via post, I cannot write to the session.

Tomorrow I would like to write my own setup on top of it in a nice way and add it like a piece of a puzzle. 95$ is paid, but I really don't know how to pay you right now. Before I started working at the company, I was talking to a friend of mine who was also interested in PHP, wordpress, etc., even when it came to OOP, MVC, etc., he used to talk about it as if it was extremely difficult things (mystical and divine things that are the result of decisions made by Greek gods), but he hardly knew it himself.

Only once idToken is created and clientSecret is shared in communication with the SSO server. Other than that, any user information that may be a security threat is not shared directly between the servers. Security issues can be fixed later. I have a bigger problem. It is a problem in the working mechanism of SSO, but I will solve it. When you log in from a different site, that site is redirected to SSO and SSO checks if that user has logged in yet. I always thought that I would keep the idtoken in the SSO's cookie and do the first check from there. Because if the SSO's cookie does not have idToken or any similar identifying data, how would I know that the user is logged in? It could be by keeping this login information in the database used by the SSO. I found it reasonable to keep it in both the SSO cookie and the database. I thought it would be healthier to keep the information about whether the user is logged in or not in their browser, but I could also keep this information in the database to compare against malicious intentions that could manipulate this. Maybe I am thinking in a complicated and wrong way. It can also be done by only looking at the IP address. Or it can be done just by looking at the cookie or the information in the database. The biggest problem now is to control the session from different client servers and save the cookies of those servers on the client side accordingly. The sweetest part of today was that I saved the client secret always changing. The client secret changes with each new login and it is also useful for security (The only way to unlock the id token is to know it. I think it's a nice little detail since all sites have one idtoken and one client secret).",

The SSO checks if there is an idToken in its cookie and checks the idToken from the database or any other place where data is kept continuously and then supplies the idToken and client secret to that server. The most important thing is to provide a good protection against forgery (checking if it comes from allowed domains). There are no other problematic aspects.",

Also, if he is not the person who logged in before, I want to give the standard form with the normal username and password. I was halfway through trying to do that. Finally, I'm thinking of adding the ability to log out of all sites. In such a case, I will need to add a middleware to the servers using that sso, to check and see if it has logged out from all of them.",

Normally, I first use \"fs.readfile()\" to consume server memory, but this way I can deliver the file to the browser in small data packets, which is much healthier in terms of performance.

If there is a different big mistake and I haven't noticed it, I think I can fix it without much difficulty in terms of logical functioning. In SSO, all user login processes are based on the SSO server. The most important issue for the client websites that this server serves is the idToken they keep in their cookies. All user information is encrypted in idToken. The only way to read idToken is the data called client secret which is kept in the database common to client servers. This data is not fixed. At each login, 2 or 3 cryptographic encryption processes (first the client id and auth code are created in this way, then that data is used to create the client secret. I guess it is very difficult to guess) is created afterwards. If the user logs out from a single client website, only the session on that site is closed. The session on the other sites remains the same. If the user wants to log out from all of them, they are logged out from all of them via SSO (Client servers query SSO with a small middleware to see if all sessions are logged out). If only one website is logged in, other websites can also access this session. So SSO becomes meaningful. I couldn't test it fully because there is no second client, but it works as I want it to.",

Only clientSecret related to authentication is kept separately for each user. User information is never transferred directly and all communication is done via idtoken, as it should be. The client server creates the client secret and transfers it to SSO only during the first login process and ensures that the idToken is created.",

After all the talk about OOP and design patterns, it makes me sad that I don't use any of them at this stage, but I think I will get there. I think what I am doing and trying to do is to build a structure that evolves rather than creating a human object in a single moment (God created it in 6 days, 14 billion years according to science?).

Tomorrow I will give a basic view with rough html and css. I will write a similar to Skype at the simplest level using html and css and then I will try to provide data exchange using socket between client and server. Obviously, if I can do this without any problems, the only thing left is to implement this code using electron. And using a database instead of a text file. ORM or ODM can be used afterwards though.

Other than that, I think I can do the task. I will be very happy for myself if I can complete my requirements this week. Tomorrow I will directly adapt the simple chat application example in socket.io to the system I wrote and try to develop it from the very basics. I think I am progressing in a systematic way (a systematic progress in my own way, of course). I think I will complete the basic parts and solve the problems as I encounter deficiencies.",

        "4": "It took us Saturday and Monday to get the simplest view of the front end. Today it was about sending the message written in the client to the server using socket.io and the server sending a response back. Yes, simple messaging was provided. But these messages had to be stored in a persistent place like a text file or a database. In the afternoon I concentrated on this and thought about what I could do. First of all, in order to make this application work consistently, I need to have 3 users. 3 users can communicate in pairs or form a group together. I haven't yet considered the possibility of 2 people being in a group, but since a group naturally has a group name, you can tell if there is a group by the presence of the group name instead of the number of people. I thought that if there was a bot user, users could communicate with him/her. I have named this bot \"Assistant\" for now. The bot user could create surveys and ask users to fill them out, for example. Or when users encounter a problem, they can contact him directly. I even wondered what it would be like if users could anonymously tell Assistant about something they are afraid to say but want to raise.",
        "5": "The most thought-provoking topic of today was how data structures should look like. At this stage, instead of using a database, the data is simply kept in json/text files. For example, \"dbClient.json\" is used for the user table, \"chat.json\" for the chat data table and \"session.json\" for the session. Today we thought about how to store user data and chat data (chat participants, chat id, chat contents, chat dates, etc.). The connection between these two different data structures (or tables/files) could be based on the id of the users and the id of the chats they are in. The current user id was obtained from session information.",
        "6": "In addition, today messages were dynamically generated using DOM methods. But the creation of messages didn't make much sense as mentioned above. Because when the user refreshes the page, all messages are naturally deleted.",
        "7": "Things I think I should work on tomorrow: ",
        "8": "If the user has a chat history, data about their past chats will be transferred to the client via socket.io. (Here, instead of transferring all messages, you can also transfer a certain character length of the last message. Just like skype's recent chats section. Then, if the user clicks on that chat, all messages can be loaded, or recent messages can be loaded, and if the user wants to see much older messages, then those messages can be pulled from the database. For now, instead of thinking about the most optimized solution, I think I will do the case where all messages are retrieved from the database)).",
        "9": "If the user has no chat history, a chat will be started with the Assistant. It will be added to the database first and then shown to the client.",
        "10": "If the user has a chat history and any of those chats have multiple participants, that chat will be seen as a group and the data will be passed to the client that way.",
        "11": "When all this is realized, it is likely that the shortcomings on the front end will be very noticeable and they will simply be fixed.",
        "12": "Another important issue is the cache structure, which I don't know much about yet. The user's past messages will definitely be retrieved from a database (or any persistent storage - like the text/json file used now). But in case the user is instant messaging, this data will of course be written to the database, but the client side data will not be retrieved from the database, but only processed by the server. When a new message is written, I guess the server does two things. First, it adds this new message to the database asynchronously. Secondly, it delivers this data to the client.",
        "13": "Obviously there is a lot to do. I try to tackle the problems in the most basic way and move forward. Each problem and solution offers a new perspective and different alternatives. Whether a user or a group has a photo or not, the group administrator and his/her authorizations, quitting a group or removing a user, and many other issues await attention. Of course, from where I am now, these are more detailed parts that I will come across in the later stages. So, I'm going to tackle more backend related problems tomorrow. I'll try to complete it.",
        "14": "Day 173",
        "15": "Honestly, I feel that I am progressing in the way I want. Of course, I don't know how important my own wishes are, but I am at least a little satisfied with the work I do myself. Today, I started to dynamically add data to the statically existing front end by taking the data from the text file. I am trying to write a code that can be changed as much as I can, that is compatible, that can be corrected by a person who looks at the code at a future time by absorbing Bruce Lee's sentence \"Be like water, my friend, take the shape of the container you are in, etc.\". In fact, there is still nothing about OOP in the code I wrote. Just because I think I have grasped a little bit of what is meant there, the thought of \"you should write a modular code Buğra\" dominates in my mind. It hasn't happened yet, but I hope I will.",
        "16": "I just came across something very small, and it was a lot of fun to learn it. I was trying to see what I could do in forEach to make the loop stop where I want it to (without affecting later parts of the code), and I found out that with the every() function, I can simply do that.",
        "17": "Today I only worked on presenting chat related data in a text file to the client as it should be. I should have used technologies like ajax/fetch to communicate with the backend from an html file. But since I created the instant messaging with socket.io, I preferred socket.io instead of fetch/ajax in the other part. I don't know how correct it is yet. The basic parts are still not finished yet. Tomorrow or Friday at the latest, I will try to build a structure where groups and people are there, and instant messages come as desired. There are many things missing. I have a lot more to do. I'm glad I do and I'm learning, because it's extremely enjoyable (not in a distorted hedonistic way, of course). But time continues to flow like water.",
        "18": "I don't know if I am doing the work of 5 people, but I think I am getting faster than before. Or I think I reinforced what you showed me a little bit (not completely, of course, but at least I think I smelled a few things like cars smelling gasoline due to high gasoline prices: how to write a good code, the technologies and tools I will use. I used to be more or less a logical person, but now I think my horizons have broadened even more. I often feel that something is not right in the parts where I am wrong. Sometimes I continue to do it wrong on purpose because the trade-off I make with my inner voice is to make a mistake and then fix that part and complete different parts). I can't do the work of 5 people, because I am one of them. I'm just a simple person with an average intelligence who wants to improve. There will always be people who are better than me in almost everything. But I will do my best.",

        "20": "I can take the messages written in the past, existing chats, necessary user information (photo, name, status, etc.) and write them in the frontend. I can also show the messages written instantly in the front end as I want. But I have some very serious problems because I built the system a little wrong. I think I know how to solve it. My problem is this: I can print past messages easily. I save the instant messages to a text file asynchronously and print them to the screen at the same time. But when I enter a different chat, these instant messages disappear. They come back when I refresh the page, of course (it does it from the text file). I know why it disappears because I wanted it to disappear and I wrote a few lines of code accordingly, because if it didn't disappear, then all the messages would be mixed in all the chats. A solution I created for one problem created a problem in a different place. So I can solve the problem by keeping the messages in a main element with the chat id and adding each new message to this chat id. I show the relevant element of the active chat and hide the part related to other chats. I don't think the way I'm going to add each new message to the database and then not pull it from there is not wrong and can be implemented. But I will fix my problems, I have completed what I wanted to do today, but I haven't solved the problems afterwards.",
        "21": "Tomorrow, if I implement the solution I mentioned above and fix the problem, I will get a bit more specific. I need to show the status that one of the people currently in the chat is writing a message. I need to give the user the ability to edit, delete, etc. Then I need to allow the user to change their status (available, busy, away, offline, etc.). I need to allow the user to go offline when they log out or disconnected. I need to show the user new incoming messages with a notification.",

Two important problems were solved today. As you said, the application was exhibiting abnormal behavior when accessing the same url from different tabs (or browser) because it was broadcasting to all sockets. I fixed that, and then I completed the status change (there are still a few things missing, but I will come back after I complete the more important things).",
        "25": "There are 3 parts left, such as reporting the presence of unread messages, showing who is typing in the chat with \"is typing\", and sending files. For the first two parts, I need to send messages from different users. For this, I need to edit the SSO section again, because in order for users to log in and write, they need to be registered in SSO and I need to transfer the necessary user data from SSO to the client server. Tomorrow I will add in the SSO section the possibility to have different users to debug the application (as it should be. I should have done it in the first place, but I think I thought too superficially when I said that I shouldn't overengineer while evaluating the problem). This edit may take some time but I have to do it. I don't think I'm in the dark, I can see the light, I think I'll get there. I expected myself to finish the part about the socket this week. After all the main problems are finished, I want to learn how to make voice and video calls and implement it if possible (if it is possible in many applications, why not?).",

I keep the authentication information of multiple users in SSO now, but I also need to edit the session part of the client. I guess I will complete it on Monday, and if I do, I think there will be no major problem left.",

I set up a structure that seemed to work correctly by following a wrong path. But then, while I was editing this structure to work correctly, I produced results that I did not want. But I think I will complete that part tomorrow. If I complete it tomorrow, a big workload will be completed. I believe it is about to happen.",

Since SSO was single-user until now, I was statically creating and simulating multi-user processes on the client server myself. I solved this problem this morning. Then I correctly created the problematic structure in the status change, the \"is typing\" part. Towards the end of the day I looked at the notification issue, but for now I don't keep the notifications in any persistent file. Temporarily only the users who are online can see the notifications that are currently coming. I'll come back to this later, because for now it's time for another problem: uploading files using socket.io. I need to send documents, photos, videos, and audio files to the server and save them in a permanent folder. On the front end, I need to provide these files to the client of course. I've often come across 2 different node modules for file uploading. I'm either going to build it completely myself or use one of these modules. I'm going to try first without using any 3rd party modules.",

Until now, the messages sent were only shown to the user as text. I hadn't thought about how to send, save and display photos, videos, documents (with pdf, doc extensions), audio files to the user. I started that part today.",

I just need to organize the different situations for different file types a bit more. I haven't added the part about the file being sent to the chat history yet. Tomorrow I will finish these things.",

The problem is that despite all the OOP work I've done, I still don't use that knowledge at all (although logically I think I'm trying to keep the modularity high, it's very insufficient).

Today, with socket.io, a file that can have about 10-15 different types (mime types) was saved in a local folder and while saving, the file was sent to the people in the relevant chat at the same time. Of course, it is necessary to keep the data about the files sent in the past chat information while opening the application. This part was started this evening. The goal is to finish it by lunch tomorrow. Actually, the logic is very simple but the implementation will take some time. When I think about it, there are still a lot of mistakes and shortcomings. The notification part is not completed, chats have been added statically (At this stage, all users can only chat with Assistant by default if they don't have a chat). Tomorrow, the necessary work will be done to show the user the files uploaded in the past. Then we will investigate how to record audio data using a microphone and send it to the other user. This will be done. Afterwards, live voice and video conversation will be added to the system. Although the dreams seem like Paris, it is estimated that the project will be completed in the desired way (like customized Skype).",

It was also transmitted live to the client and the client was able to download the files presented as documents. Photo, video and audio files could be opened and viewed in the front-end section and also downloaded. There was a problem today. Socket.io by default allowed sending a maximum of 1Mb of data. If we wanted to send more, it would close and reopen the connection as if nothing happened.",

Sending the data in chunks was initially considered, but this shortcut was chosen because it seemed like a more laborious way.",

I was going to go straight to the topic, but then I wanted to look at algorithms related to search in the book of algorithms. When I looked, I just read the different types of problems and solutions there. And of course I thought about them. For example, there was the \"Travelling salesman problem\" that I came across while looking at graph algorithms. I want to think about it on Sunday and look at its applications.

Of course it may be absurd, but one of them is this: almost all visual technologies are based on a screen or a plane and the eyes that look at it obtain the light. I thought of a projector that could change the direction of the light source by tracking the movement of the pupil, a tiny projector with a predetermined maximum power (it shouldn't cause temporary or permanent blindness). Then I realized that this idea was unnecessarily complicated and difficult. Then came the idea of increasing the viewing angle to 360 degrees with cameras. When you mentioned the rocket project, I thought about what I could do with Arduino. Or I thought about how a small rocket simulation could be written on the web. I tried to imagine what I could do in such a simulation using technologies such as Webgl, three.js, or d3. Honestly, there are so many things that can be done... I don't know the priorities of my motivators at work or I avoid making myself rank them, but one of them is definitely that there is so much to do. I'm glad.",

I think that when the authentication part is completed tomorrow, there will not be many problems on OOP. If there are problems, I think they can be fixed without difficulty. Of course, I also need to make the backend codes of the SSO server object-oriented. When all this is done, the basic features of an application including knowledge base and bug tracking will be extracted. In accordance with these features, a summary software requirements document can be prepared, or a template of objects with general requirements and usage scenarios suitable for these requirements can be created before implementing the system.

Then I will try to use cloudflare after simply serving content (like hello word) through the domain address.

I've used a web browser for years, but I've never consciously thought about how it works until now. The idea of each tab as a separate process, the idea of blocking malware with sandboxing, how the asynchronous structure was written out of necessity (yes, I already knew these things or learned them without realizing it). The part about the reason for writing the V8 js engine and the lack of a good garbage collector was also a very enjoyable read.

For example, there is a separate api for clipboard. For example, the clipboard api is presented as a separate api in electron in a very similar way.

The Inter Process Communication part is as I understand it (I'm writing it again because I may look at these notes in the future): When Chrome or any browser is running, the user can open multiple tabs. As far as I understand, the most primitive browsers are thought of as a single tab. In case of multiple tabs, it was necessary to separate the JavaScript operations and memory operations of each tab. Because if a site explodes in one tab, all other tabs are affected and the browser crashes (I remember it hard because it was a long time ago, but yes there was such a thing). Each tab was called a separate process and all these small processes were managed by a main process. This method was later adopted by all other browsers. Electron follows the same logic here and divides it into main process and rendering process. It seemed like it could be considered as two separate contexts. ",

Since I had problems changing the color of the top bar, I completely hid the top bar and rewrote it in the rendering process section as I wanted. While writing, I added minimizing, maximizing, unmaximizing, closing functions to this section. Normally incoming notifications only appear in the application. But if the page of the person using the application is minimized, I should ensure that the desktop notification comes. Tomorrow I will add this part. Of course, I will do this with the api provided by electron. Today I also organized the page sizing part according to the case of using electron. In general, I will only give electron-specific rendering operations to the relevant files as a separate file. Tomorrow I will complete that part as well.",

Then I packaged the application with the electron builder library. It worked. But there was a problem. The cookie data was lost when the application was closed. It was also disappearing when running in Electron, but I thought it would be fixed when it was built. It didn't. Then I searched for how to fix it. I haven't solved this problem yet, but just like with notifications, I can use a native api that electron provides for sessions. I think it could be done without using it, but I couldn't do it even if I tried. I will try a different solution first thing tomorrow.",
        "31": "Day 219",
        "32": "After clarifying my thinking this morning, I solved my problem with a little google search. Basically, the cookie information was already coming into the electron app. But it wasn't storing this data somewhere permanently (like modern browsers do). The \"changed\" event was listened for changes in cookies. When the cookies changed, the session information was saved to a default location that Electron itself set. Then the application was packaged and ready to use. At this stage, the application satisfies me. But it needs further development (Webrtc, fixing the notification part, front-end improvements, and of course optimizing the process of pulling chat data from the backend to make it scalable).",

I thought about the possibility of applying your idea of \"writing the algorithm and outputting it in a programming language\" to all languages. It would be nice (Of course, it would be meaningful and advanced if such a thing was open source and open for everyone to develop). Today was spent briefly brushing up on my PHP knowledge."

        "5": "I'd like to make one last description so that I don't get carried away. A framework is like a faith/culture. Developers who use the same framework find a common ground, get along with each other and live in tolerance and live happily in the future generations by continuing the same belief and culture. The language of this belief/culture is the spoken language of the developers. Some developers can be nationalistic in their beliefs/language. Some are multicultural by saying \"make peace don't war\", taking pollen from every language and belief and making honey. Laravel is like Judaism. It is an ancient faith and it derived from other faiths. And it opened the door to other beliefs. It has such a strong structure that it and the beliefs from which it derives have a very strong following. The language it uses is not very common anymore. And other languages are very popular. This does not cause the death of the language, but it decreases its popularity and decreases its community. ",

The lesson I learned today was that if I write a piece of code, I need to explain why that code exists. Of course, when you read a piece of code, you can understand what it does, but trying to put all the pieces together can be difficult.",

        "4": "Today I was a bit distracted and I was not thinking much about what he talked about in the meeting. Other than that, I'm going to replicate the front end of the parachute with the methods I've learned so far (like flex).",
        "5": "Day 243",
        "6": "Worked on the new add invoice page today. I tried to make a similar page to the one in Parasut, but it's not finished yet. But I think tomorrow at least the static part will be completed and the functionality will be started.",
        "7": "Day 244",
        "8": "Today I completed most of the static part of the invoice page, but it's not finished yet. It inevitably takes more time when designing it in detail. Tomorrow I will try to finish the invoice insertion page.",
        "9": "Day 245",
        "10": "Although the majority of the page is statically complete, it is taking more time than I expected. While my goal was to complete 1 page a day, the basic 'HTML/CSS/JS' part of a single invoice insertion page of the parachute took 3 days (90%). Either I was too slow or the page was really detailed even though it looked like it was not. I think the second option is correct. I will try to complete the static parts quickly until tomorrow lunch break and now show the information from the api on the page.",
        "11": "Day 246",
        "12": "The static part of the add sales invoice page has been completed. It was made as similar as possible to the relevant page of the parachute. The JavaScript parts inevitably took a little more time as they involve more logical operations. Dynamic data will be added tomorrow.",
        "13": "Day 247",
        "14": "Today I started showing the data received from API on the invoice insertion page. Customer search, tax rates, currency information are shown in the required sections. Category, product and tag search results will also be shown in the relevant sections on the page. The calculations may also need to be redone (as the functions for subtotaling and discounts for each individual product in Parachute have been added). Finally, it remains to send the data by post and show any errors.",
        "15": "This page took too much time. A similar structure could be put in place for the expense invoices page so that at least less time is spent there.",
        "16": "Day 248",
        "17": "The inaccuracies in category search, product search, formatting of numbers were fixed today. Tomorrow first thing is to fix the problem of adding too many event listener in the code I wrote for the products search. Then I will complete the invoice calculations and sending the relevant post request to the api.",
        "18": "Day 249",
        "19": "Today I completed most of the price calculations of the products on the invoice adding page. When I write the gross total calculation part and the Turkish Lira equivalent of the total amount according to the selected currency, it will only remain to send the post request to save the invoice to the api.",
        "20": "Day 250",
        "21": "I completed the page today. There's still the part about sending the post and the viruses. This page was a failure for me. The JavaScript codes were too complicated and there was no trace of simplicity. I will learn from this page and try to write better on other pages.",
        "22": "Day 251",
        "23": "Today the sales invoice adding page was completed. There were errors in the relevant API methods and they were fixed.",
        "24": "The display of error messages in the front end code, sending the data in the appropriate format in the API request; When we encountered the problem that some columns in the database were not filled, the relevant repository and model were fixed.",
        "25": "Tomorrow I'll start a different page.",
        "26": "Day 252",
        "27": "Today, invoice adding pages have been completed. Filtering and search section has been added on the page where expense invoices are listed. However, since the accuracy of the data in the search section is low, the display of the results has not yet been done. Then the expense invoice editing page was started. It is estimated that the sales and expense invoice editing pages will be completed tomorrow.",
        "28": "Day 253",
        "29": "Today the majority of both invoice update pages have been completed. Although the calculations are done correctly, there are a few formatting issues left, but that will be fixed later. In addition, corrections were made in the backend code and database (Today was generally spent with these corrections). Tomorrow, after a few deficiencies of the sales invoice editing page are fixed, the invoice detail pages will be started.",
        "30": "Day 254",
        "31": "Today, the deficiencies in the add/correct invoice pages were completed (some roughness remained in the number formatting part) and the invoice detail/payment page was started.",
        "32": "There was poor performance today. There were a lot of questions and issues on my mind. The departure of my supervisor (teacher) and not saying goodbye (ghosting) left a bad emotional scar. At a moment during the day when I couldn't pay attention to work, I reread the article you shared with us titled \"What is an engineer, what does he/she do, how many types of engineers are there?\"",
        "33": "\"Today, I realize once again that my professors actually helped me find the best answer to the questions \"who is an engineer and what does he/she do\". The engineer solves problems. The problem-solving engineer is the synthesis of the eastern and western perspectives, writes, gives and reads reports. The engineer who gives a written report is acceptable. While writing a report, he/she defines problems, finds creative solutions, has the opportunity to see what he/she has not seen, has to interpret what he/she has written and draw conclusions, and the writing stays and the words fly away. The engineer who writes good reports reads good reports and questions well. The engineer who sees this fact has completed his/her individual institutionalization and is a very good managerial candidate. Senior managers who are aware of this fact know the value of the treasure in their hands. Those who cannot see it realize their material and moral losses later.\"",
        "34": "The woman who wrote the article's description of the ideal engineer fit my manager. It should have suited me too, because I wanted to be a good engineer. I had studied at school, but I realized that it was not enough to study at school. It was in this office that I saw engineering in its fullest sense for the first time. It was the first time I was so fascinated by magic, and then of course I learned it was illusion. By the time I realized the illusion, what I had learned had increased a lot compared to my previous level, and therefore the rush and panic in my mind started to decrease.",
        "35": "It reads like my suicide note and the report is quite out of context, but the final report may have the right to add a little bit of sentimentality.",
        "36": "One of the greatest chances and opportunities in my life was to meet you. I found a treasure. I tried to grab something from the treasure as much as I could. I tried to add something to the treasure with this intellectual poverty. Even though I don't know what my abilities are more or less, I tried. Hoping that fortune favors the one who tries, I will continue to learn with a great appetite, to find better solutions to problems, to create good relationships with people and myself. My biggest goal right now is to try to be as good as you and then to rise above that level (if any).",
        "37": "I think this 11-month period and you will remain very, very, very precious in my mind because I met you and established a beautiful bond."
